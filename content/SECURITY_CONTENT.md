## SECURITY: NWL

### Exposure Narrative

NWL is the **primary operating asset** in the IIC facility. Through grant-funded prepayments (DTIC + GEPF) and the Creation Capital DSRA, IIC's **actual credit exposure only begins at month 36** — and at a **substantially lower balance** than the NWL Senior IC loan.

### Protection Timeline

| Period | Coverage | Protection |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Construction (M0–M18) | Full drawdown phase | No repayment obligation — EPC (Colubris) holds technology risk |
| Grace period (M18–M24) | DSRA funded from CC mezzanine | No cash flow required from operations |
| DSRA P1 (M24–M30) | DSRA covers first debt service | IIC has zero credit exposure |
| DSRA P2 (M30–M36) | DSRA covers second debt service | IIC has zero credit exposure |
| First exposure (M36+) | Operations must service debt | IIC exposed at substantially reduced balance |
| Steady state (M36–M108) | Normal debt service from EBITDA | Declining balance, increasing equity coverage |

### Conclusion

ECA cover should be sized to the **M36 exposed balance** — not the full facility amount. The combination of grant-funded prepayments (DTIC R25M + GEPF R44.8M = €3.24M at M12-M18) and DSRA coverage (M24-M36) means IIC's first real exposure is at a fraction of the NWL Senior IC loan.

## SECURITY: LanRED

### Credit Enhancement

LanRED is either independently underwritten by a third-party insurer, or covered via a cross-currency swap (bank-to-bank exposure) — depending on asset and sculpting choices. Each investment within LanRED has its own EPC contractor.

### Security Elements

- **PPA contracts** with NWL (inter-company) and Smart City tenants provide contracted revenue certainty
- **Physical assets** (solar PV panels, battery storage systems) serve as tangible collateral
- **Must-run grid connection** via Lanseria Airport substation — never subject to load shedding
- **Growth optionality** — as Smart City grows, LanRED captures increasing off-take without additional capex

## SECURITY: Timberworx

### Security Elements

- **Centre of Excellence** — physical asset with demonstrated rental income stream
- **Panel Equipment** — Optimat machines with proven production capacity
- **CoE sale to LLC** planned at Year 4 at 10% premium — provides capital gain and exit mechanism
- **VH Properties corporate guarantee** provides additional credit support

## SECURITY: SCLCA

### Security Package — How It Works

IIC lends to SCLCA. SCLCA onward-lends to three subsidiaries: **New Water Lanseria** (water treatment and management), **LanRED** (solar and battery storage), and **Timberworx** (Centre of Excellence). The security package has three layers per the Creation Capital term sheet:

- **Layer 1 — Financial Claims** (holding level): IC loan receivables (€15,879,884) pledged to IIC + 100% equity in all subsidiaries (€99,000) pledged to Creation Capital + DSRA at project level (compounding at 9% p.a.). Pure financial claims — no guarantees at this level.
- **Layer 2 — Guarantees, Insurance & Credit Enhancements** (per subsidiary, pushed down by CC to IIC):
  - **NWL**:
    - Veracity corporate guarantee (full IC loan) + Atradius ECA cover (to be applied, sized to M36 balance)
    - Debt service cover & FX hedge — DSRA/FEC (semi-bank-to-bank) *or* Cross-Currency Swap (bank-to-bank exposure), per debt sculpting toggle
    - Pre-revenue cash flow for prepayment — DTIC R25M + GEPF R44.8M grants
  - **LanRED**: Independent underwriting *or* Cross-Currency Swap (bank-to-bank exposure) — per asset and sculpting choices
  - **Timberworx**: Phoenix corporate guarantee (VH Properties, full IC loan) + Atradius ECA cover (to be applied, full IC loan €2,048,149 — vanilla, fully guaranteed from M24)
- **Layer 3 — Physical Assets & Revenue Contracts** (per subsidiary): MABR plant (€2.45M), Colubris BoP (€1.72M), civils (€3.75M), solar PV (€2.51M), BESS (€0.4M), CoE building (€1.66M), panel equipment (€0.2M) — plus soft costs, fees, and contracted revenue streams (municipal offtake, PPAs, timber panel fabrication pipeline R177.9M)

NWL's ECA cover is sized to the M36 exposed balance after grants and DSRA — see NWL Security for the detailed exposure analysis.
