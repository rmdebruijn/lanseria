## SECURITY: NWL

### Exposure Narrative

NWL is the largest envelope (€9,104,041 senior) and carries the most sophisticated security structure. Three layers of risk reduction bring IIC's real exposure down to **€0.9–3.9M**, which is then covered by a corporate guarantee. IIC's first real credit exposure to Veracity as a guarantor begins at **month 36** — after construction, after grant prepayments, after swap coverage. By that point, NWL is operational and generating revenue.

### Layered Risk Reduction

**Step 1: Grant and Bulk Services Prepayments (€3,236,004 at M12)**

The DTIC Manufacturing Incentive (R25M) and GEPF Bulk Services Fee (R44.8M) combine to prepay €3.24M of NWL senior debt at month 12. This is non-diluting — it simply reduces the outstanding balance. Both carry **sovereign risk**: DTIC is a South African government incentive programme, GEPF is the Government Employees Pension Fund.

€9.1M → DTIC + GEPF prepay (R69.8M / €3.24M at M12) → **€5.9M**

**Step 2: Cross-Currency Swap (€2–5M)**

Investec cross-currency swap on NWL's remaining EUR exposure. The structure: two back-to-back loan contracts (not a derivative — no margin calls, no mark-to-market). Investec receives EUR from NWL, delivers ZAR during construction, and collects ZAR repayments from water revenue. This is **bank-to-bank risk**: IIC's exposure on the swapped portion transfers to Investec.

Sizing: minimum €2M, target €5M. Per Investec's analysts, the forex profile is commercially attractive — the staged ZAR release during construction and long ZAR repayment tail make this an interesting position.

- Minimum swap (€2M): €5.9M − €2M = **€3.9M residual**
- Target swap (€5M): €5.9M − €5M = **€0.9M residual**

The swap also provides the FX hedge — EUR obligations are converted to ZAR at source.

*Alternative (not preferred):* Creation Capital could fund a DSRA of ~€2M at M24. However, this may fall outside CC's mandate and complicates the ongoing mezz/equity negotiation. The Investec swap is the cleaner path.

**Step 3: Veracity Corporate Guarantee (residual €0.9–3.9M)**

The remaining balance after grants and swap is guaranteed by Veracity Property Holdings — **corporate guarantee risk**. Veracity is a South African property holding company with R746.5M total assets, R692.9M investment property, and R53.4M equity. Parent of 11 operating entities across Gauteng, the Winelands, and KwaZulu-Natal.

### Protection Timeline

| Period | Coverage | Risk Type |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Construction (M0–M18) | Full drawdown phase | EPC (Colubris) holds technology risk |
| Grant prepayment (M12) | DTIC + GEPF reduce balance by €3.24M | Sovereign risk |
| Grace period (M18–M24) | Swap coverage begins | Bank-to-bank risk (Investec) |
| M24–M36 | Swap + DSRA cover debt service | Bank-to-bank / CC mezzanine |
| First guarantee exposure (M36+) | Operations must service residual | Corporate guarantee (Veracity) |
| Steady state (M36–M108) | Normal debt service from EBITDA | Declining balance, increasing equity coverage |

### Conclusion

Atradius ECA cover to be applied for — sized to M36 exposed balance after grants and swap coverage. The combination of grant-funded prepayments (sovereign risk), currency swap (bank-to-bank risk), and corporate guarantee means IIC's first real credit exposure to Veracity begins at a fraction of the NWL senior loan.

## SECURITY: LanRED

### Credit Enhancement

LanRED's security depends on the asset strategy. In both scenarios, **IIC has no direct project credit risk** — exposure transfers to a third party.

**Greenfield scenario:** The full senior loan (€2,739,516) is independently underwritten by a third-party insurer. IIC's credit exposure transfers to the underwriter — **insurance company risk**. Standalone 2.4 MWp PV + 1.5 MWh BESS serving NWL and Smart City tenants.

**Brownfield+ scenario:** Cross-currency swap against existing PPA revenue. Investec receives EUR from entity, delivers EUR to IIC. Entity repays in ZAR from PPA revenue — **bank-to-bank risk**. The brownfield portfolio generates R2.08M/month from 5 existing PPA sites — contracted, escalating revenue from Day 1. This cash flow underpins the swap. Portfolio: 2.17 MWp across 5 operational sites.

Either way: IIC has no direct LanRED project credit risk.

Atradius ECA cover: may be absent or limited depending on Dutch content in the chosen asset strategy.

### Security Elements

- **PPA contracts** with NWL (inter-company) and Smart City tenants provide contracted revenue certainty
- **Physical assets** (solar PV panels, battery storage systems) serve as tangible collateral
- **Must-run grid connection** via Lanseria Airport substation — never subject to load shedding
- **Growth optionality** — as Smart City grows, LanRED captures increasing off-take without additional capex

## SECURITY: Timberworx

### Corporate Guarantee

The full senior loan (€1,753,747) is guaranteed by VH Properties, which holds 40% in the Phoenix Group — a portfolio of retail shopping centres in South Africa managed by Broll Property Group.

- **Portfolio EBITDA:** R57M across 5 retail centres (all with Broll management reports)

Atradius ECA cover to be applied for — full senior loan amount.

- **Panel Equipment** — Optimat machines with proven production capacity
- **CoE sale to LLC** planned at Year 4 at 10% premium — provides capital gain and exit mechanism
- **VH Properties / Phoenix corporate guarantee** provides full credit support — corporate guarantee risk

## SECURITY: SCLCA

### Three Operating Companies, Three Envelopes

SCLCA has been structured as three independent operating companies, each within its own financing envelope. Each entity has its own senior loan from IIC (via SCLCA intercompany), its own revenue stream, and its own security package. A credit event in one entity does not cascade to the others. IIC's exposure is managed per envelope — and in two of the three, IIC has no direct project credit risk at all.

| Entity | Senior Loan | Security Type | IIC Exposure | Risk Transfer |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **Timberworx** | €1,753,747 | Corporate guarantee + ECA | Fully guaranteed | VH Properties / Phoenix |
| **LanRED** | €2,739,516 | Underwriting or Currency Swap + ECA | Bank-to-bank or insurance | Investec or underwriter |
| **NWL** | €9,104,041 | Grants + Currency Swap + guarantee + ECA | €0.9–3.9M after risk reduction | Veracity Property Holdings |
| **Total** | **€13,597,304** | | | |

Atradius DSB (Netherlands) ECA cover to be applied for on all three envelopes.

### Security Package — Three Layers

- **Layer 1 — Financial Claims** (holding level): IC loan receivables (€15,879,884) pledged to IIC + 100% equity in all subsidiaries (€78,000) pledged to Creation Capital. Pure financial claims — no guarantees at this level.
- **Layer 2 — Guarantees, Insurance & Credit Enhancements** (per envelope):
  - **NWL**: Grants & bulk services prepayments (€3.24M, sovereign risk*) + Investec cross-currency swap (€2–5M, bank-to-bank risk**) + Veracity corporate guarantee (residual €0.9–3.9M) + Atradius ECA cover (sized to M36 balance)
  - **LanRED**: Independently underwritten (insurance company risk***) OR cross-currency swap (bank-to-bank risk**) + Atradius ECA cover (may be absent/thin depending on Dutch content)
  - **Timberworx**: VH Properties / Phoenix corporate guarantee (full senior €1,753,747, coverage 1.56x) + Atradius ECA cover (full senior loan)
- **Layer 3 — Physical Assets & Revenue Contracts** (per subsidiary): MABR plant (€2.45M), Colubris BoP (€1.72M), civils (€3.75M), solar PV (€2.51M), BESS (€0.4M), CoE building (€1.66M), panel equipment (€0.2M) — plus contracted revenue streams (municipal offtake, PPAs, timber panel fabrication pipeline R177.9M)

\* Sovereign risk (DTIC grant is a South African government incentive; GEPF is a state pension fund)
\*\* Bank-to-bank risk (Investec cross-currency swap — two loan contracts, not a derivative)
\*\*\* Insurance company risk (independent underwriter assumes IIC's credit exposure)

Of the total €13.6M senior facility:
- **€1.8M** (Timberworx) — fully guaranteed by VH Properties / Phoenix — **corporate guarantee**
- **€2.7M** (LanRED) — transferred to underwriter or Investec — **insurance or bank-to-bank risk**
- **€3.2M** (NWL grants & bulk services) — prepaid at M12 — **sovereign risk, reduces balance permanently**
- **€2–5M** (NWL swap) — transferred to Investec — **bank-to-bank risk**
- **€0.9–3.9M** (NWL residual) — covered by Veracity — **corporate guarantee**
