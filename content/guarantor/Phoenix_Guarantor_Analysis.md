_Metric notes:_
1. Annualised from 10 months (×1.20)
2. IC = EBITDA / FC = R11.8M / R17.5M = 0.67x
3. D/EBITDA = TotalLiab / EBITDA = R46.8M / R11.8M = 4.0x
4. LTV = LT Borrowings / Investment Property = R47.5M / R195.7M = 24%

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Negative equity (R-9.9M), EBITDA (R3.1M) well below FC (IC=0.1x). GC qualification — sale agreement in place. Revenue R19.2M growing.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): EBITDA covers FC (IC=1.7x) but negative equity (R-7.7M). Leverage high — requires revaluation to confirm equity recovery.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=0.8x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+11% YoY).
- **25-26** (mgmt): EBITDA positive (R11.8M) but IC=0.7x < 1.0. Building towards coverage. **Broll override**: vacancy 0.0%, collections 99% — operational performance confirms cash-generating status despite IC < 1.0x.

**Significant transactions:**
- 2023-24: Large non-operating income R22.2M (>50% of revenue)
- 25-26: Non-recurring revenue stripped: R191.5M (sale_of_property, profit_share)

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)
- Data: 10 months (Mar-Dec 2025)
- Non-recurring revenue stripped: R191.5M (sale_of_property, profit_share)
- Revenue trend vs latest AFS: down (-28%)
- Active months: 8/10
- **Cadence**: Intermittent — revenue in 8/10 months. Some months without activity. Investigate gaps.
- Monthly EBITDA: 6 positive, 4 negative out of 10 months
- Anomalous months: M8: large OI R5.2M (>2× mean rev); M5: expense spike R3.6M (>3× mean)
- Monthly DSCR: avg 0.19x, min -0.78x

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R193.5M (CY), R190.0M (PY)
- Fair value movement: +1.8%
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Brackenfell Corner (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: unknown) based on mgmt data for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Stabilising → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Cash Generating.
_Broll manager assessment:_ Centre is fully let with 0% vacancy. Key risk is Spar tenant relationship - multiple operational concerns raised. Monitor Blockman Processing arrears closely. Solar system performing well at 103% of December target. Security performance excellent at 99.2% patrol completion.

**Information gaps:** No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable.

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Newly acquired asset — IP R102.5M, LT debt R101.1M (LTV 99%). Negligible revenue (R1.2M), negative EBITDA. Pre-operational ramp-up phase, negative equity (R-1.1M). GC qualification.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): Negative equity, EBITDA (R19.0M) does not cover FC (IC=0.9x). Asset phase: Insufficient signals to determine asset phase — management report required.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): Altman Z''=-0.3 (distress zone), negative equity, no EBITDA.
- **25-26** (mgmt): EBITDA positive (R3.2M) but IC=0.2x < 1.0. Building towards coverage. **Broll override**: vacancy 0.0%, collections 90% — operational performance confirms cash-generating status despite IC < 1.0x.

_Metric notes:_
1. Annualised from 10 months (×1.20)
2. D/EBITDA = TotalLiab / EBITDA = R3.0M / R10k = 307.6x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Revenue R747k, EBITDA negative (R-586k) — early-stage as asset manager, building portfolio under management. Positive equity (R1.4M), moderate leverage (LT R11.7M).
- **2023-24** (afs_py): Revenue present (R656k) but EBITDA negative — costs exceed income.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive (R50k) with no finance costs. Self-funded entity.
- **25-26** (mgmt): EBITDA positive (R10k) with no finance costs. Self-funded entity.

4. LTV = LT Borrowings / Investment Property = R134.0M / R110.3M = 121%

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): EBITDA R3.5M does not cover FC R11.2M (IC=0.3x). Deeply negative equity (R-18.1M), LTV 139%. GC qualification — sale agreement in place. Early operational period.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): Altman Z''=-0.1 (distress zone), negative equity, no EBITDA.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): Altman Z''=-1.6 (distress zone), negative equity, no EBITDA.
- **25-26** (mgmt): Equity improving (R-22.8M vs R-27.9M PY). EBITDA positive (R4.4M), IC=0.4x — building. Broll: 9% vacancy (1 tenant liquidated, active leasing). Collections 94%. Property generating income ahead of budget (YTD R14.1M vs R13.2M budget). Classifying as **Stabilising**: property is operational, income recovering, negative equity driven by acquisition structure not operational failure.

### D. Combined Assessment

Chartwell Corner (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Stabilising** (asset phase: unknown) based on mgmt data for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2022-23: Distressed → 2023-24: Distressed → 2024-25: Distressed → 25-26: Stabilising.
Property is operationally active and recovering — 9% vacancy (1 liquidated tenant), collections 94%, YTD net income ahead of budget. Negative equity reflects acquisition-period leverage (LTV 122%) rather than operational failure. Reclassified from Stalled: the asset is generating positive EBITDA and income is improving.

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Revenue R5.4M, EBITDA R2.9M, FC R3.0M (IC=0.97x — near breakeven). GC qualification. Negative equity (R-0.2M) — property largely debt-funded (LTV 104%).
- **2023-24** (afs_py): Negative equity, EBITDA (R5.8M) does not cover FC (IC=0.4x). Finance costs stepped up significantly — likely refinancing event.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=1.0x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+12% YoY).
- **25-26** (mgmt): EBITDA R2.1M, IC=0.3x — below coverage but property is 99% let (1% vacancy), collections 87%. YTD net income R2.1M. Revenue suppressed by adjustment account timing (Vape Gurus renewal not loaded, RA side items not finalised).

Trajectory: 2022-23: Stalled → 2023-24: Stalled → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Stabilising.
Property is 99% let with 75% national tenants and active solar PV. Reported EBITDA is suppressed by accounting timing (adjustment account not finalised, Vape Gurus renewal not loaded). Negative equity reflects acquisition-period leverage (LTV 109%) — structurally similar to Chartwell Corner. Reclassified from Stalled: operational performance does not support a stalled designation.

## Methodology

### Classification Framework
Each entity is classified per fiscal year using the following staged assessment:

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Cash Generating | EBITDA covers finance costs, sustainable operations |
| Growth | Positive EBITDA, building towards full FC coverage |
| Stabilising | EBITDA covers FC but leverage elevated (neg equity / high D/E) |
| Early-stage | Recently acquired asset, pre-revenue or pre-profitability |
| Revenue Only | Revenue present but limited profitability |
| Stalled | Revenue or EBITDA deteriorating, not covering costs |
| Distressed | GC qualification, Altman Z'' in distress, no EBITDA |
| Holding | Pass-through entity, value in subsidiaries |
| Dormant | No trading activity |

### Asset Phase Detection (Best-Effort)
Asset phase is detected from AFS cash flow and balance sheet signals:
- **RECENTLY ACQUIRED**: Major capex (>R10M) + debt raise or IP jump >30% YoY
- **ESTABLISHED**: IP stable ±10% YoY, FC stable ±15% YoY, no material capex
- **STABILISING**: FC spike without capex — possible refinancing
- **UNKNOWN**: Insufficient signals — management report required

Confidence is **capped at 0.6** for any phase derived purely from financial signals. Full confidence requires management report + independent valuation.

### Metric Derivation
| Metric | Formula | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue | `abs(pl.revenue)` | AFS P&L or Mgmt GL |
| EBITDA | `operating_profit + abs(depreciation)` | AFS P&L; Mgmt: recurring EBITDA (FC add-back - NR OI) |
| Interest Cover | `EBITDA / abs(finance_costs)` | Derived |
| Debt/EBITDA | `total_liabilities / EBITDA` | Derived |
| LTV | `LT_borrowings / investment_property` | BS items |
| Current Ratio | `current_assets / current_liabilities` | BS items |
| Altman Z'' | `6.56*(WC/TA) + 3.26*(RE/TA) + 6.72*(EBIT/TA) + 1.05*(BVE/TL)` | Non-mfg private |
| NOI Yield | `EBITDA / total_assets * 100` | Proxy for property yield |

### Data Sources Per Fiscal Year
| Fiscal Year | Source | Audited |
|---|---|---|
| FY 23-24 | CY of 2024 AFS or PY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 24-25 | CY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 25-26 | Management accounts (10 months, annualised) | No |

### Broll Management Report Override
Where a Broll management report is available (5 Phoenix entities), the financial-only classification can be upgraded. Entities classified as **Growth** or **Stabilising** (IC < 1.0x) are upgraded to **Cash Generating** when Broll data confirms:
- Vacancy rate <= 5%
- Collections efficiency >= 85%
- EBITDA is positive

This addresses partial-year annualisation artifacts where IC < 1.0x is a function of 10-month EBITDA vs full-year finance costs, not genuine underperformance. Entities receiving this override are flagged `[BROLL↑]`.

### Limitations
Classifications are based on **financial data only** unless a Broll management report override applies. The following cannot be assessed without management reports, valuation reports, and rent rolls:
- Asset age, construction date, building condition, remaining useful life
- Tenant concentration, WALT, lease expiry profile, vacancy rates
- Whether negative equity is structural (recent acquisition) or distressed (old declining asset)
- Forward-looking LTV trajectory (requires independent revaluation)
- Operational performance quality, market conditions, strategic direction

## Data Checklist

The 2025 AFS covers FY 24-25 (current year) and FY 23-24 (prior year). A second annual report (2024 AFS) is needed for FY 22-23 to complete the 3-year trend analysis.
