_Metric notes:_
1. IC = EBITDA / FC = R16.2M / R7.9M = 2.05x — **includes ~R9.5M fair value adjustment** in AFS operating profit; ex-FV IC ≈ 0.85x
2. D/EBITDA = TotalLiab / EBITDA = R69.9M / R16.2M = 4.3x
3. LTV (book) = LT Borrowings / Investment Property = R66.7M / R74.2M = **90%** (corrected from 13% — original missed R57.2M mortgage bonds)
4. CR = CA / CL = R2.3M / R1.3M = 1.80x
5. LT Borrowings breakdown: ABSA Senior R44.1M + ABSA Mezz R12.2M + RSAD Foreign Loan R8.4M + RSAD capital interest R1.6M + Other R328k = R66.7M

**Quasi-equity adjustment (RSAD shareholder loans):**
The RSAD loans (R10.3M) are shareholder/related-party debt with interest accruing to the loan balance rather than being cash-paid. These are treated as **quasi-equity** — subordinated to ABSA, non-cash servicing, investor return rather than third-party obligation. RSAD interest is a quasi-dividend, not a senior debt cost.

| Metric | Book (all debt) | Adjusted (ex-quasi-equity) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Senior debt | R66.7M | R56.4M (ABSA only) |
| LTV | 90% | **76%** |
| FC (AFS, ex-FV EBITDA ~R6.7M) | R7.9M → IC 0.85x | ~R6.5M → **IC 1.03x** |
| FC (mgmt, recurring EBITDA ~R5.0M) | R5.4M → IC 0.92x | ~R4.6M → **IC ~1.09x** |
| D/EBITDA | 4.3x | 3.5x |

On a senior-debt-only basis, the entity covers its cash finance costs. Management's confirmation of cash flow positive is consistent with the adjusted view.

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Shell entity — R120 total assets, no revenue, no operations. Incorporated but inactive.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): No revenue, no EBITDA, minimal assets — effectively dormant.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): AFS EBITDA R16.2M includes ~R9.5M FV adjustment. Ex-FV EBITDA ≈ R6.7M. Book IC 0.85x (all debt), **adjusted IC 1.03x** (senior debt only). Classified as **Cash Generating** on adjusted basis — RSAD quasi-equity treatment confirms senior debt coverage. LTV 76% adjusted.

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)
- Data: 10 months (Mar-Dec 2025)
- Revenue: R7.1M (single tenant)
- PBT: R17.2M (includes R16.8M fair value adjustment on investment property)
- Recurring EBITDA (ex-FV): ~R5.0M
- Finance costs (total): R5.4M (10m)
- Finance costs (senior, ABSA only): ~R4.6M (10m)
- **Recurring IC (book): 0.92x** — below 1.0x on total finance costs
- **Recurring IC (adjusted, ex-quasi-equity): ~1.09x** — covers senior debt service
- Total debt (mgmt BS): R66.7M (of which ~R10.3M quasi-equity)
- Investment property (post-FV): ~R91M
- LTV (book, mgmt): 73% (post fair value uplift)
- LTV (adjusted, senior only): ~62%

**FV adjustment dependency:** Same pattern as 6 On Kloof — AFS operating profit inflated by a large fair value adjustment. On an adjusted basis (ex-FV, ex-quasi-equity), the entity covers its senior debt. Management confirms entity is cash flow positive — consistent with RSAD interest accruing rather than being cash-paid. AFS cash flow statement shows R7.9M interest paid, but this is a full-year figure including the period before the RSAD was restructured as accruing; management accounts (10m) show lower cash FC of R5.4M.

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R74.2M (CY), n/a (PY)
- Mgmt accounts: ~R91M (post R16.8M FV adjustment)
- No independent valuation report available.
- FV adjustment of R16.8M in mgmt accounts (23% uplift) — needs independent verification.

### D. Combined Assessment

Ireo Project 10 (Proprietary) Limited is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: established) on an adjusted basis — qualifying RSAD shareholder loans as quasi-equity and excluding the associated accruing interest from finance costs.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Dormant → 2024-25: Cash Generating (adjusted).

**Book vs adjusted view:**
- Book: IC 0.85x (AFS ex-FV) / 0.92x (mgmt recurring), LTV 90% → would classify as Growth
- Adjusted (ex-quasi-equity): IC 1.03x (AFS ex-FV) / ~1.09x (mgmt recurring), LTV 76% → **Cash Generating**

The RSAD loans (R10.3M) are shareholder/related-party instruments with interest that accrues to the loan balance. They function as quasi-equity — subordinated, non-cash-serviced, and representing an investor return rather than a third-party obligation that could trigger default. Treating these as quasi-equity brings entity-level IC above 1.0x and LTV below 80%, consistent with management's assertion that the entity is cash flow positive.

Property: Erf 21445 Bellville, 30 Sacks Circle (industrial/commercial). Single tenant (Chepstow Properties / related entity). Held via Cornerstone Property Group (100%) → Veracity Property Holdings.

LTV corrected from 13% to **90% book / 76% adjusted** — the original calculation only captured R9.6M (other_financial_liabilities) but missed R57.2M (mortgage_bonds). Total LT borrowings = R66.7M, of which R56.4M is senior (ABSA) and R10.3M is quasi-equity (RSAD).

**Remaining risks:** Single tenant concentration — 100% of revenue from one related-party tenant; Fair value dependency — R16.8M uplift (23%) unverified by independent valuation; Quasi-equity treatment requires confirmation that RSAD loans are formally subordinated and interest is indeed accruing (loan agreements not sighted).

**Information gaps:** No Broll management report (single tenant, not applicable); No independent valuation report — R16.8M FV uplift unverified; No rent roll — single tenant, lease terms and expiry unknown; RSAD loan agreements not sighted — subordination and accrual terms to be confirmed.

_Metric notes:_
1. Annualised from 10 months (×1.20)
2. IC = EBITDA / FC = R14.3M / R11.9M = 1.20x
3. D/EBITDA = TotalLiab / EBITDA = R130.1M / R14.3M = 9.1x

5. CR = CA / CL = R684k / R12.4M = 0.06x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): EBITDA R17.7M covers finance costs (IC=1.5x). LTV 85%. Self-sustaining, established track record.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): EBITDA R20.6M covers finance costs (IC=1.7x). D/EBITDA 6.9x LTV 79%. Self-sustaining.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=0.9x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+6% YoY).
- **25-26** (mgmt): EBITDA R14.3M covers finance costs (IC=1.2x). D/EBITDA 9.1x LTV 78%. Self-sustaining.

**Significant transactions:**
- 2023-24: Large non-operating income R17.8M (>50% of revenue)
- 2024-25: Large non-operating income R9.4M (>50% of revenue)

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)
- Data: 10 months (Mar-Dec 2025)

| Total expenses (11m) | R9.80M | — |
| Net income (11m) | R13.52M | — |

| Leasing & Occupancy | |
|---|---|
| Vacancy | 0% (Unit 9 re-let to Webco, replacing NWL) |
| Lease expiry ≤12m | 25.9% of GLA (renewals confirmed) |
| Tenant concentration | Allied Paint (x2 units), Orde Group (x5), South Group Recycling (x2), KK Doughnuts (x3), plus Jaycor, Cushy Lush, Hair Health & Beauty, Prime Health, Crest Leather, Celtic Refrigeration, Shop and Ship, Bull and Bush |

_Key issues:_
- Unit 9 (NWL replacement — Webco): R0 actual rent vs R42.8k/month budget (R442.8k YTD shortfall) — new tenant, rent-free period or late start
- Transformer upgrade needed
- Several units show R0 actual rent in tenant schedule (Units 3, 13, 17) — likely operational recoveries only or rent-free periods

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R160.5M (CY), R160.5M (PY)
- Fair value movement: +0.0%
- Municipal valuation: R67.98M (Broll report) — significant gap vs AFS fair value (R160.5M), though municipal valuations typically lag market.
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Mistraline (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: established) based on mgmt data for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Cash Generating → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Cash Generating.

Broll management report (Jan 2026) confirms strong operational performance: 15,070m² industrial park at full occupancy (0%), 11 tenants across 22 units, net income of R13.5M on 11 months. Lease expiry concentration of 25.9% within 12 months has been addressed with renewals confirmed. The NWL replacement tenant (Webco, Unit 9) is not yet contributing rent — once normalised, income should improve further.

**Remaining risks:** Lease expiry 25.9% in 12 months — renewal risk despite confirmations; Transformer upgrade needed — capex obligation; AFS fair value (R160.5M) vs municipal valuation (R67.98M) — wide gap, no independent valuation to reconcile; Current ratio 0.06x — liquidity stress.

**Information gaps:** No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; Unit 9 rent commencement date unknown.

_Metric notes:_
1. FY 25-26 figures from 10-month management accounts (Mar–Dec 2025); P&L not annualised, balance sheet as at Dec 2025
2. IC (25-26) = EBITDA / FC = R8.2M / R6.0M = 1.36x (recurring, no FV adjustment)
3. IC (24-25) = R8.8M / R6.1M = 1.45x — includes R5.9M FV adjustment in operating profit; ex-FV IC = 0.48x
4. D/EBITDA (25-26) = TotalLiab / annualised EBITDA = R89.8M / R9.8M = 9.1x
5. LTV = Mortgage bond R72.4M / Investment Property R81.9M = 88%
6. CR = CA / CL = R6.6M / R18.4M = 0.36x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2023-24** (afs_py): Altman Z''=-2.2 (distress zone), negative equity, no EBITDA. Pre-operational — hotel under acquisition/fit-out.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA R8.8M covers FC (IC=1.5x). However, R5.9M of EBITDA is a one-off FV adjustment; ex-FV IC = 0.48x. Hotel launched Dec 2024 — only 3 months of revenue in this AFS.
- **25-26** (mgmt): 10 months of recurring hotel operations. EBITDA R8.2M (no FV adjustment) covers FC R6.0M — IC=1.36x. Validates Cash Generating classification on a recurring operating basis.

**Significant transactions:**
- 2023-24: Major capital expenditure R31.9M (hotel acquisition)
- 2024-25: Major capital expenditure R42.2M (hotel fit-out)
- 2024-25: Fair value adjustment R5.9M on investment property (one-off, included in AFS operating profit)

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)

- Hotel manager: Perch Short Stays (Pty) Ltd
- Revenue (10m YTD): R16.9M (accommodation R15.6M + add-ons R533k + restaurant R718k + other R72k)
- Revenue vs budget: -4.4%
- EBITDA (10m YTD): R8.2M — margin 48.5%
- Finance costs (10m YTD): R6.0M (Investec mortgage bond)

- Monthly EBITDA: positive every month (R820k/month average)

**Seasonality Profile**

| Period | Occupancy | ADR | RevPAR | EBITDA margin | Monthly IC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| YTD avg (10m) | 68.4% | R1,524 | R1,043 | 48.5% | 1.36x |

_Seasonality: Winter months pull YTD occupancy to 68%. ADR strategy active — rates increase in peak/holiday periods (Dec R2,450 vs Nov R1,989) while occupancy dips. Summer months all >79%. Winter occupancy implied ~50–60%. Hotel remains EBITDA-positive through the cycle._

- No new FV adjustment recognised in FY 25-26 management accounts (R5.9M from Feb 2025 AFS carried forward)
- Fair value movement (FY 24-25): +150.8% (reflects hotel fit-out capex R42.2M)
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

6 On Kloof Proprietary Limited is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: recently_acquired) based on 10-month management accounts for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Distressed → 2024-25: Cash Generating → 25-26: Cash Generating.

The AFS classification (IC=1.45x) was mechanically correct but relied on a R5.9M one-off fair value adjustment within operating profit. Stripping this, AFS ex-FV IC was only 0.48x. The 10-month management accounts now independently confirm Cash Generating status: recurring EBITDA of R8.2M covers finance costs of R6.0M, giving IC=1.36x with no FV contribution. The hotel has been revenue-positive every month since launch, with EBITDA margin averaging 48.5% across a full seasonal cycle (including winter trough).

Equity has doubled from R1.3M (Feb 2025) to R2.8M (Dec 2025) through retained earnings. LTV has improved from 89% to 88%. Cash reserves of R5.2M provide 8.6 months of debt service cover.

**Remaining risks:** Shareholder loans of R16.5M classified as current liabilities — subordination agreement needed for ECA comfort; No independent valuation — IP at cost + R5.9M FV adj, no third-party confirmation of market value; Altman Z'' remains in distress zone (-0.16) driven by high leverage, not operating distress; Winter occupancy data not granular — YTD average 68% pulled down by off-season months.

**Information gaps:** No independent valuation report — cap rate and market comparables unavailable; AFS 2024 not received (Mark to provide); Shareholder loan terms not documented; Granular monthly P&L for winter months not available (only Dec/Nov itemised in reports received).

5. CR = CA / CL = R-3.3M / R621k = -5.28x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Dormant — newly incorporated, only R100 share capital, no operations.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): EBITDA R9.7M covers FC (IC=19.2x). Cash generating — first operational year, property acquisition completed during the year.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=0.3x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+996% YoY).

- Property: Tyrwhitt No 2, Johannesburg
- Manager: Grapnel Property Management
- Mark confirms: monthly rent report + IS from management company only — no BS or full management report
- Providence rent roll mentioned but not yet received

_Note: The R1.4M "owner transfer" in expenses is not a true operating cost — it is a distribution to the property owner. Adjusting for this, true operating expenses ≈ R500k, giving an operating margin of ~81%. The Grapnel IS confirms the property is generating rental income consistently._

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R49.6M (CY), R49.6M (PY)
- Fair value movement: +0.0%
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Providence Property Investments (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Growth** (asset phase: established) based on mgmt data for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Cash Generating → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Growth.

The Grapnel management company IS (11m to Jan 2026) confirms the property at Tyrwhitt No 2, JHB generates consistent rental income (R2.67M) with low operating costs (R500k ex-owner transfer). However, entity-level IC remains 0.28x — the property income does not cover the entity's finance costs (R5.1M annualised), confirming Growth classification. LTV 142% indicates the entity is significantly underwater on its debt.

**Remaining risks:** LTV 142% — deeply underwater; IC 0.28x — not covering finance costs; No BS from management company — cannot verify property-level debt or cash position; Equity declining (R9.4M → R5.1M → R2.9M over 3 years).

**Information gaps:** No balance sheet from management company; Rent roll not yet received (Mark to provide); No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; Tenant mix, WALT, and vacancy rate unknown.

**Note:** Providence also holds a 20% associate interest in Manappu Investments (50 units, Tyrwhitt JHB). No AFS available — not assessed.

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Negative equity (R-309k), property recently acquired (R39.5M IP, large debt draw). EBITDA (R1.6M) does not cover FC (IC=0.8x). Early ramp-up year.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): EBITDA positive (R3.0M) but IC=0.5x < 1.0. Building towards coverage. Equity turned positive following fair value uplift.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=0.5x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+15% YoY).
- **25-26** (mgmt): Negative equity, EBITDA (R4.0M) does not cover FC (IC=0.6x). Asset phase: Management accounts — no prior year CF data for asset phase detection.

_Single-tenant property fully let to Otis. No vacancy, no tenant concentration risk beyond the single-tenant structure itself. Broll manages the property._

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R46.7M (CY), R48.0M (PY)
- Fair value movement: -2.7%
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Erf 86 Longmeadow Business Estate (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Stalled** (asset phase: established) based on mgmt data for FY 25-26.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Growth → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Stalled.
Negative equity is a key risk — without independent revaluation, it is unclear whether this is structural (acquisition debt) or distressed.

Broll management report (Dec 2025) confirms the property is fully let to a single tenant (Otis) with 0% vacancy and YTD net income of R3.4M. The Stalled classification reflects financial metrics (IC=0.64x, LTV 101%, negative equity) rather than operational distress — the property is performing.

**Remaining risks:** Single tenant concentration — 100% income from Otis; LTV 101% — underwater on book value; Negative equity (R-624k) — structural from acquisition leverage; IC 0.64x — not covering finance costs from operating income alone.

**Information gaps:** No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; Otis lease terms, expiry date, and escalation rate unknown.

Sun Property Investments (Pty) Ltd is reclassified as **Holding / Intermediate** — it is an investment holding company with no investment property on its balance sheet. Its primary asset is a 25% associate interest in 6 On Kloof Proprietary Limited (assessed separately as an operating entity). The negative equity (R-8.7M) and prior "Distressed" classification reflected the entity's shell status post-property disposal, not an operating asset in distress.

**Information gaps:** Nature and terms of the 6 On Kloof shareholding; intercompany loan balances; any residual liabilities or contingent claims.

### D. Combined Assessment

Cornerstone Property Group (Pty) Ltd is classified as **Holding / Intermediate** — it is an investment holding company (R160 total assets, R120 equity) that exists solely to hold 100% of Ireo Project 10 (Proprietary) Limited, which is assessed separately as an operating entity. No direct operations.

**Information gaps:** Nature of the holding structure; any intercompany obligations or contingent liabilities.

## Methodology

### Classification Framework
Each entity is classified per fiscal year using the following staged assessment:

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Cash Generating | EBITDA covers finance costs, sustainable operations |
| Growth | Positive EBITDA, building towards full FC coverage |
| Stabilising | EBITDA covers FC but leverage elevated (neg equity / high D/E) |
| Early-stage | Recently acquired asset, pre-revenue or pre-profitability |
| Revenue Only | Revenue present but limited profitability |
| Stalled | Revenue or EBITDA deteriorating, not covering costs |
| Distressed | GC qualification, Altman Z'' in distress, no EBITDA |
| Holding | Pass-through entity, value in subsidiaries |
| Dormant | No trading activity |

### Asset Phase Detection (Best-Effort)
Asset phase is detected from AFS cash flow and balance sheet signals:
- **RECENTLY ACQUIRED**: Major capex (>R10M) + debt raise or IP jump >30% YoY
- **ESTABLISHED**: IP stable ±10% YoY, FC stable ±15% YoY, no material capex
- **STABILISING**: FC spike without capex — possible refinancing
- **UNKNOWN**: Insufficient signals — management report required

Confidence is **capped at 0.6** for any phase derived purely from financial signals. Full confidence requires management report + independent valuation.

### Metric Derivation
| Metric | Formula | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue | `abs(pl.revenue)` | AFS P&L or Mgmt GL |
| EBITDA | `operating_profit + abs(depreciation)` | AFS P&L; Mgmt: recurring EBITDA (FC add-back - NR OI) |
| Interest Cover | `EBITDA / abs(finance_costs)` | Derived |
| Debt/EBITDA | `total_liabilities / EBITDA` | Derived |
| LTV | `LT_borrowings / investment_property` | BS items |
| Current Ratio | `current_assets / current_liabilities` | BS items |
| Altman Z'' | `6.56*(WC/TA) + 3.26*(RE/TA) + 6.72*(EBIT/TA) + 1.05*(BVE/TL)` | Non-mfg private |
| NOI Yield | `EBITDA / total_assets * 100` | Proxy for property yield |

### Data Sources Per Fiscal Year
| Fiscal Year | Source | Audited |
|---|---|---|
| FY 23-24 | CY of 2024 AFS or PY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 24-25 | CY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 25-26 | Management accounts (10 months, annualised) | No |

### Broll Management Report Override
Where a Broll management report is available (5 Phoenix entities), the financial-only classification can be upgraded. Entities classified as **Growth** or **Stabilising** (IC < 1.0x) are upgraded to **Cash Generating** when Broll data confirms:
- Vacancy rate <= 5%
- Collections efficiency >= 85%
- EBITDA is positive

This addresses partial-year annualisation artifacts where IC < 1.0x is a function of 10-month EBITDA vs full-year finance costs, not genuine underperformance. Entities receiving this override are flagged `[BROLL↑]`.

### Quasi-Equity Adjustment [QE]
Where an entity carries shareholder or related-party loans with the following characteristics, those loans are treated as **quasi-equity** for metric computation:
- Interest **accrues** to the loan balance rather than being cash-paid (confirmed by gap between AFS cash flow statement and management accounts)
- Loan is **subordinated** to senior bank debt (structurally or contractually)
- Lender is a **shareholder, director, or related party** (investor return, not arm's-length obligation)

When the quasi-equity adjustment applies:
- **IC (adjusted)** = EBITDA / senior finance costs only (excluding quasi-equity interest)
- **LTV (adjusted)** = senior debt / investment property (excluding quasi-equity from numerator)
- **D/EBITDA (adjusted)** = senior liabilities / EBITDA

Both book (all debt) and adjusted (ex-quasi-equity) metrics are reported. Classification may be upgraded where adjusted IC ≥ 1.0x. Entities receiving this adjustment are flagged `[QE]` in the overview table.

**Applies to:** Ireo Project 10 (RSAD shareholder loans R10.3M). Providence also has shareholder loans (loans_from_shareholders in AFS NCL) — quasi-equity treatment to be assessed when loan terms are confirmed.

### Co-Ownership Consolidation [CO-OWN]
Where an entity holds a fractional interest in a property but carries 100% of the associated debt (or vice versa), entity-level metrics are structurally misleading. In such cases, **consolidated economic metrics** are computed by attributing the entity's proportional share of total property income against its actual debt obligations.

- **IC (consolidated)** = (entity revenue + ownership% × co-owner revenue) / entity FC
- **LTV (consolidated)** = entity debt / (ownership% × total property value)
- Both entity-level and consolidated figures are reported.
- Entities receiving this adjustment are flagged `[CO-OWN]` or `²` in the overview table.

**Applies to:** Chartwell Corner (50% co-owner, carries 100% debt — see Phoenix report).

### Limitations
Classifications are based on **financial data only** unless a Broll management report override applies. The following cannot be assessed without management reports, valuation reports, and rent rolls:
- Asset age, construction date, building condition, remaining useful life
- Tenant concentration, WALT, lease expiry profile, vacancy rates
- Whether negative equity is structural (recent acquisition) or distressed (old declining asset)
- Forward-looking LTV trajectory (requires independent revaluation)
- Operational performance quality, market conditions, strategic direction

## Data Checklist

The 2025 AFS covers FY 24-25 (current year) and FY 23-24 (prior year). A second annual report (2024 AFS) is needed for FY 22-23 to complete the 3-year trend analysis.
