_Metric notes:_
1. IC = EBITDA / FC = R16.2M / R7.9M = 2.05x
2. D/EBITDA = TotalLiab / EBITDA = R69.9M / R16.2M = 4.3x

4. CR = CA / CL = R2.3M / R1.3M = 1.80x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Shell entity — R120 total assets, no revenue, no operations. Incorporated but inactive.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): No revenue, no EBITDA, minimal assets — effectively dormant.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA R16.2M covers finance costs (IC=2.0x). D/EBITDA 4.3x LTV 13%. Self-sustaining.

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)
No management accounts available for this entity.

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R74.2M (CY), n/a (PY)
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Ireo Project 10 (Proprietary) Limited is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: unknown) based on afs_cy data for FY 2024-25.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Dormant → 2024-25: Cash Generating.
Asset phase could not be determined from financial data alone — management report required to assess property age, condition, and market position.

**Information gaps:** No management report — asset age, tenant quality, and property condition unknown; No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; No rent roll — tenant concentration, WALT, and vacancy rate unknown.

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R80.0M (CY), R31.9M (PY)
- Management accounts: Investment property at cost R74.1M + FV adjustment R5.9M = R80.0M (consistent with AFS)
- Fair value movement: +150.8% (reflects hotel fit-out capex R42.2M in FY2024-25)
- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

6 On Kloof Proprietary Limited is classified as **Cash Generating** (asset phase: recently_acquired) based on afs_cy data for FY 2024-25.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Distressed → 2024-25: Cash Generating.
Hotel launched December 2024 — early operational data is strong (94% occupancy, 64% EBITDA margin in Feb 2025). High LTV (89–97%) reflects acquisition leverage; equity has turned positive. Recently acquired asset in ramp-up phase.

**Information gaps:** No independent valuation report — cap rate and market comparables unavailable; No full-year management accounts — only 3-month launch period available; AFS 2024 not received (Mark to provide).

4. CR = CA / CL = R2.5M / R112.3M = 0.02x

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): EBITDA R18.7M covers finance costs (IC=1.1x) — only year with positive cover. Revenue R38.4M. GC qualification already in place; trajectory declining.
- **2023-24** (afs_py): EBITDA positive (R18.5M) but IC=0.9x < 1.0. Building towards coverage. GC qualification by auditors — downgraded.
- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive (R11.3M) but IC=0.5x < 1.0. Building towards coverage. GC qualification by auditors — downgraded.

### B. Management Account Analysis (FY 25-26)
No management accounts available for this entity.

### C. Valuation Analysis
- AFS fair value: R336.9M (CY), R336.9M (PY)

- Full valuation report needed to assess methodology, cap rate, and market comparables.

### D. Combined Assessment

Uvongo Falls No 26 Proprietary Limited is classified as **Stabilising** (asset phase: established) based on afs_cy data for FY 2024-25.
Trajectory: 2023-24: Stabilising → 2024-25: Stabilising.
Going concern qualification by auditors indicates material uncertainty.

**Information gaps:** No management report — asset age, tenant quality, and property condition unknown; No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; No rent roll — tenant concentration, WALT, and vacancy rate unknown.

**Per-year justification:**
- **2022-23** (afs_2024_py): Negative equity (R-309k), property recently acquired (R39.5M IP, large debt draw). EBITDA (R1.6M) does not cover FC (IC=0.8x). Early ramp-up year.

- **2024-25** (afs_cy): EBITDA positive but IC=0.5x < 1.0. Revenue growing (+15% YoY).
- **25-26** (mgmt): Negative equity, EBITDA (R4.0M) does not cover FC (IC=0.6x). Asset phase: Management accounts — no prior year CF data for asset phase detection.

**Significant transactions:**

Trajectory: 2023-24: Growth → 2024-25: Growth → 25-26: Stalled.
Negative equity is a key risk — without independent revaluation, it is unclear whether this is structural (acquisition debt) or distressed.
Asset phase could not be determined from financial data alone — management report required to assess property age, condition, and market position.

**Information gaps:** No management report — asset age, tenant quality, and property condition unknown; No independent valuation report — LTV trajectory and market comparables unavailable; No rent roll — tenant concentration, WALT, and vacancy rate unknown.

### D. Combined Assessment

Sun Property Investments (Pty) Ltd is reclassified as **Holding / Intermediate** — it is an investment holding company with no investment property on its balance sheet. Its primary asset is a 25% associate interest in 6 On Kloof Proprietary Limited (assessed separately as an operating entity). The negative equity (R-8.7M) and prior "Distressed" classification reflected the entity's shell status post-property disposal, not an operating asset in distress.

**Information gaps:** Nature and terms of the 6 On Kloof shareholding; intercompany loan balances; any residual liabilities or contingent claims.

## Methodology

### Classification Framework
Each entity is classified per fiscal year using the following staged assessment:

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Cash Generating | EBITDA covers finance costs, sustainable operations |
| Growth | Positive EBITDA, building towards full FC coverage |
| Stabilising | EBITDA covers FC but leverage elevated (neg equity / high D/E) |
| Early-stage | Recently acquired asset, pre-revenue or pre-profitability |
| Revenue Only | Revenue present but limited profitability |
| Stalled | Revenue or EBITDA deteriorating, not covering costs |
| Distressed | GC qualification, Altman Z'' in distress, no EBITDA |
| Holding | Pass-through entity, value in subsidiaries |
| Dormant | No trading activity |

### Asset Phase Detection (Best-Effort)
Asset phase is detected from AFS cash flow and balance sheet signals:
- **RECENTLY ACQUIRED**: Major capex (>R10M) + debt raise or IP jump >30% YoY
- **ESTABLISHED**: IP stable ±10% YoY, FC stable ±15% YoY, no material capex
- **STABILISING**: FC spike without capex — possible refinancing
- **UNKNOWN**: Insufficient signals — management report required

Confidence is **capped at 0.6** for any phase derived purely from financial signals. Full confidence requires management report + independent valuation.

### Metric Derivation
| Metric | Formula | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue | `abs(pl.revenue)` | AFS P&L or Mgmt GL |
| EBITDA | `operating_profit + abs(depreciation)` | AFS P&L; Mgmt: recurring EBITDA (FC add-back - NR OI) |
| Interest Cover | `EBITDA / abs(finance_costs)` | Derived |
| Debt/EBITDA | `total_liabilities / EBITDA` | Derived |
| LTV | `LT_borrowings / investment_property` | BS items |
| Current Ratio | `current_assets / current_liabilities` | BS items |
| Altman Z'' | `6.56*(WC/TA) + 3.26*(RE/TA) + 6.72*(EBIT/TA) + 1.05*(BVE/TL)` | Non-mfg private |
| NOI Yield | `EBITDA / total_assets * 100` | Proxy for property yield |

### Data Sources Per Fiscal Year
| Fiscal Year | Source | Audited |
|---|---|---|
| FY 23-24 | CY of 2024 AFS or PY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 24-25 | CY of 2025 AFS | Yes |
| FY 25-26 | Management accounts (10 months, annualised) | No |

### Broll Management Report Override
Where a Broll management report is available (5 Phoenix entities), the financial-only classification can be upgraded. Entities classified as **Growth** or **Stabilising** (IC < 1.0x) are upgraded to **Cash Generating** when Broll data confirms:
- Vacancy rate <= 5%
- Collections efficiency >= 85%
- EBITDA is positive

This addresses partial-year annualisation artifacts where IC < 1.0x is a function of 10-month EBITDA vs full-year finance costs, not genuine underperformance. Entities receiving this override are flagged `[BROLL↑]`.

### Limitations
Classifications are based on **financial data only** unless a Broll management report override applies. The following cannot be assessed without management reports, valuation reports, and rent rolls:
- Asset age, construction date, building condition, remaining useful life
- Tenant concentration, WALT, lease expiry profile, vacancy rates
- Whether negative equity is structural (recent acquisition) or distressed (old declining asset)
- Forward-looking LTV trajectory (requires independent revaluation)
- Operational performance quality, market conditions, strategic direction

## Data Checklist

The 2025 AFS covers FY 24-25 (current year) and FY 23-24 (prior year). A second annual report (2024 AFS) is needed for FY 22-23 to complete the 3-year trend analysis.
