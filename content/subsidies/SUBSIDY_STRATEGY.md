# Subsidy Strategy

## Why Subsidies Are a Core Engine — Not a Side Benefit

---

### The Three Phases

Every project moves through three phases:

1. **Origination** — a project arrives on our plate, from us or from external promoters
2. **Incubation** — we take the project and make it bankable (expensive, time-consuming, specialist-intensive)
3. **Raising** — Frontier Funding finances the project through the Credit Stack (Layer A→B→C→D)

Incubation is where the money burns. Feasibility studies, engineering, permitting, legal structuring, demonstrations, specialist retainers, promoter management — all before a single euro of project finance is committed. This is funded through the **Development Fund**: EUR 3.5M, revolving.

"Revolving" means it must come back. Projects repay at financial close or pre-operations. But that is slow and late. If the fund drains before projects close, the pipeline dies.

**Subsidies solve this.** They replenish the Development Fund early — during incubation, not after close — by creating the conditions for vendors to invest their own business development budgets into project preparation.

### Why Subsidies — The Real Value

Subsidies are not free money for NexusNovus. The subsidy lands with the vendor — always. NexusNovus never applies for or receives subsidy funds (Contract A governs this).

The value to NexusNovus is indirect but massive. It flows through four channels:

#### 1. Free Cash Flow: 10% Success and Admin Fee (Contract A)

Every subsidy application that results in an award generates a 10% fee split: the Subsidy Agent takes a commission, NexusNovus takes an admin/success fee. This is taken off the top before anything else.

On a EUR 190k DHI grant, that's EUR 19k to NexusNovus — free cash flow, no development fund capital deployed.

Across a pipeline of 12 vendor-subsidy combinations at EUR 90k-190k each, the Q1 committed pipeline alone generates **EUR 132k in success fees** to NexusNovus.

#### 2. You Buy Loyalty: Promoter Retainers (Contract B)

Without the promoter, you can't do it. The promoter requires money regardless — their expertise, their network, their local knowledge. Paying them out of the Development Fund is a cash drain.

Through Contract B, the vendor's business development budget funds the promoter retainer. The subsidy made the vendor liquid; the vendor commits BD budget; part of that budget pays the promoter.

**Examples from the tracker:**
- Cradle Cloud / LeafCloud: EUR 60k promoter retainer (Jan) funded from vendor BD budget
- Leafy Greens / Hortilife: EUR 20k promoter retainer
- BIAL / Colubris: EUR 40k promoter retainer
- Timberworx / OptiMat: EUR 40k promoter retainer (Eckardt)

This is cash NexusNovus would otherwise spend from the Development Fund. Every euro of retainer paid through vendor BD budget is a euro the Development Fund doesn't have to deploy.

> "Just getting a subsidy to pay that promoter is cash to us — because we get his expertise. The promoter would require money regardless." — Voice note, 11 Feb 2026

#### 3. You Get Specialists to Do the Work (Contract B)

Feasibility studies, engineering assessments, demonstrations, environmental impact studies — all require specialists. Through Contract B, the vendor's BD budget pays for these specialists.

The exporters themselves often assist regardless — their own engineers do assessments as part of pre-positioning. But external specialists (environmental, legal, financial modelling) are funded from the BD budget.

**Examples from the tracker:**
- Cradle Cloud / LeafCloud: EUR 42k specialists
- Every other vendor: EUR 20k specialists baseline
- Philip / Finland: EUR 100k specialists (timber technology expertise)

This speeds up incubation. Faster incubation = faster Development Fund recovery = larger pipeline capacity for Frontier Funding.

#### 4. The Stacking Effect: Multiple Subsidies, Same Project

This is where the real leverage sits.

The first subsidy for a project funds the promoter retainer, specialists, and assets. The second subsidy for the same project — from a different vendor, different programme, different scope — **doesn't need to pay the promoter again.** The retainer is already funded.

So the second, third, fourth, fifth subsidy application increasingly flows to buffer, to assets, or to additional specialists. The marginal cost drops; the marginal return rises.

> "In the first subsidy, you already got the retainer for the promoter. In the second subsidy, you don't need to pay for it anymore. Pile five different subsidy applications — holy [expletive], that's how you make the money." — Voice note, 11 Feb 2026

**Example: BIAL (Bangalore Airport WtE) — 5 vendors, 5 subsidy applications:**

| Vendor | Subsidy | Amount | Retainer | Specialists | Buffer | NN Success Fee |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Colubris | DHI | EUR 90k | EUR 40k | EUR 20k | EUR 12k | EUR 9k |
| AcriPlug | Finland | EUR 90k | EUR 0 | EUR 20k | EUR 52k | EUR 9k |
| Mavitech | DHI | EUR 90k | EUR 0 | EUR 20k | EUR 52k | EUR 9k |
| CircuWorld | DHI | EUR 190k | EUR 0 | EUR 20k | EUR 82k | EUR 19k |
| Nepra | TBD | — | — | — | — | — |

First application: EUR 40k retainer + EUR 20k specialists = EUR 60k of real incubation cost covered.
Second through fourth: retainer is zero. Specialists stay at EUR 20k baseline. Buffer accumulates.

Five applications on one project: EUR 46k success fees to NexusNovus + EUR 40k promoter retainer funded + EUR 80k specialists funded + EUR 198k buffer. Total value to NexusNovus: **EUR 364k** — from a project that would otherwise cost the Development Fund EUR 90k+ in retainers and specialists alone.

### What We Would Normally Spend

The tracker shows a direct comparison: what the Development Fund would have to pay without subsidies vs what it actually pays with the subsidy/BD budget structure in place.

| Category | Without Subsidies (Dev Fund) | With Subsidy Structure (Vendor-Funded) |
|----------|----------------------------:|---------------------------------------:|
| Assets | EUR 200k | EUR 200k (funded via Contract B) |
| Promoter retainers | EUR 80k | EUR 160k (doubled capacity, vendor-funded) |
| Specialists | EUR 282k | EUR 282k (funded via Contract B) |
| **Total incubation cost** | **EUR 562k** | **EUR 0 from Dev Fund** |
| NN success fees | — | **EUR 132k** (free cash flow) |
| Buffer (flexible reserve) | — | **EUR 414k** |

The Development Fund deploys **zero** on these line items. The same incubation work gets done — better, because the vendor is motivated (ROFR) — and NexusNovus additionally earns EUR 132k in success fees and accumulates EUR 414k in flexible buffer.

---

### Connection to Frontier Funding (MPA Clause 3 + 8)

The Master Partnership Agreement (MPA) establishes the contractual framework:

- **Clause 3 (Development Fund):** EUR 3.5M revolving, replenished from success fees and subsidy inflows (Clause 3.3)
- **Clause 8 (Subsidy Strategy):** Partner shall support subsidy applications through exporter-of-record positioning; subsidy inflows contribute to Development Fund replenishment; retainers may be conditional on subsidy application initiation

The MPA's "subsidy inflows" language in Clause 3.3 and 8.2 refers to the **indirect** replenishment mechanism: vendor BD budgets (Contract B) fund incubation costs that the Development Fund would otherwise bear. The fund is replenished not by receiving subsidy cash directly, but by not having to deploy it.

The **Vendor-First Doctrine** (MPA Clause 2.3, Recital E) explains why vendors must be engaged early: they unlock both subsidy access (exporter-linked programmes) and ECA access (exporter-of-record for export credit). Without vendor structuring early, neither engine works.

### The Green Light Rule

When three contracts are signed for a project — **JDA/GDA** (Joint/General Development Agreement) + **Contract A** + **Contract B** — Saskia is green-lit:

- Incubation spend authorised
- Subsidies can be pursued
- Vendors formally engaged
- ECAs and banks approachable
- Internal teams execute

No further permissions required. The contracts are the authority.

---

### The Subsidy Lifecycle Stack

Programmes are not random — they form an escalation ladder. Each phase unlocks progressively larger instruments. The art is sequencing.

> "Subsidies don't finance projects — they finance the removal of excuses not to invest. Each phase neutralises a specific objection. The winners are those who sequence best."

```
  PHASE 1                PHASE 2                 PHASE 3                PHASE 4

**The principle:** seed quick wins in Phase 1 to build traction, then co-fund strategic bets in Phase 2–3. Each successful early grant builds the track record and co-financing base that makes the next, larger application credible.

**DFI Technical Assistance** runs alongside Phases 2–4 and funds feasibility, engineering, ESIA, and structuring (EUR 200k–1.5M per project): DIF, FMO, EIB TA, Finnfund, DEG, Proparco.

### Stacking Rules — How Multiple Subsidies Coexist

Stacking is the core of the strategy. But it has rules. Violate them and you face clawback.

#### De Minimis Cap
EUR 300,000 over any rolling 3-fiscal-year period per single undertaking (group cumulation applies). De minimis-compatible programmes: DHI (NL), Business Finland Tempo (FI), MIT Haalbaarheid (NL).

#### GBER Article 25 State Aid Caps (before SME bonuses)
| Activity | Base cap | +20% small firm | +15% collaboration |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Industrial Research | 50% | 70% | 65% |
| Experimental Development | 25% | 45% | 40% |
| Feasibility Studies | 50% | 70% | — |

#### The Non-Overlap Rule
No double-funding of the same cost from two public sources. You **can** fund different technical scopes from different grants. The key is distinct, non-overlapping activities.

**Example (Cradle Cloud):**
- DEI+ Phase 2 → renewable energy orchestration feasibility, grid interconnection, battery storage economics
- MOOI Phase 2 → thermal loop modelling, district HVAC design, industrial heat offtaker integration
- Different technical domains, different deliverables, no audit overlap. Both advance the same project.

#### Tax Credits Stack with Grants
WBSO (NL), Forschungszulage (DE), CIR (FR), Forschungsprämie (AT), UK R&D scheme — all operate through the tax system and generally do not count as overlapping funding. You can reduce payroll tax via WBSO while claiming full salary in a grant budget.

#### National + EU Combination
You cannot use a national subsidy to cover the co-financing share of an EU grant. But you can split scope: Module A under national grant, Module B under EU grant.

#### Innovatiekrediet
Cannot be combined with other subsidies on the same costs. It can finance one project phase while a grant finances a different phase.

#### Geographical Stacking
Dutch side → RVO. Finnish side → Business Finland. German side → ZIM/BMWK. Different countries, different vendors, meeting at the same project. This is how Eurostars works formally and how NexusNovus operates informally.

**Compliance discipline:** maintain an Aid Ledger per group entity across all grant types. Every application must reference cumulated aid received.

### How Projects Stack in Practice

#### Cradle Cloud — Multi-Phase, Multi-Country
LeafCloud (NL) anchors the Dutch track. Finnish partners open Finnpartnership. The project spans 6 jurisdictions and multiple programmes across all 4 phases:

| Phase | Programme | Scope | Amount |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | DHI (NL) | LeafCloud export feasibility | EUR 100k |
| 1 | DHI DEMO (NL) | Cooling SME demonstration | EUR 100k |
| 1 | Finnpartnership | NPP / Centria consulting | EUR 200k |
| 2 | DEI+ | Renewable energy orchestration feasibility | TBD |
| 2 | MOOI | Thermal loop / district heating design | TBD |
| 2 | Innovatiekrediet | Technical development (separate phase) | TBD |
| 3 | Horizon Europe | Multi-partner demonstrator | TBD |
| 3 | Digital Europe | Data centre / AI infrastructure | TBD |

Each programme funds a distinct technical domain. No overlap. The same project attracts EUR 400k+ in Phase 1 alone, with Phase 2–3 potentially adding millions.

#### BIAL Airport WtE — 5 Vendors, 5 Countries
The stacking effect at its most concentrated. Five vendors from different countries, each eligible for their own national programme:

- **Colubris (NL)** → DHI: system integration feasibility
- **AcriPlug (FI)** → Finnpartnership/Business Finland: Finnish technology adaptation
- **Mavitech (NL)** → DHI: processing equipment demonstration
- **CircuWorld (NL)** → DHI: circular economy feasibility (larger scope, EUR 190k)
- **Austrian biogas supplier** → FFG Basisprogramm / Klima- und Energiefonds: R&D and demonstration

Strategic track: Horizon Europe Cluster 5 (Climate, Energy & Mobility) for multi-partner EU-India waste-to-energy consortium (EUR 3-10M, medium-term).

#### Leafy Greens / BioHub Asia — DHI Dual Track
Two separate DHI applications for the same project cluster:
- DHI #1: Kenya (HortiLife) — already approved
- DHI #2: Thailand (Van den Hoeven / tropical climate adaptation) — TRL 6-7 development

Van den Hoeven is not SME → not DHI-eligible as lead. Workaround: SME tech partner (heat-pump/control OEM) leads, VDH participates. Strategic follow-on: Horizon Europe / Global Gateway for BioHub Asia scale.

#### Smart City Lanseria — Swedfund + GG-ESIM
Different architecture: government-to-government preparation facility, not vendor-led.

- **Swedfund G2G**: Sweco AB (SE) leads engineering/systems integration under IWSA consortium. Up to 100% feasibility costs. Lanseria SEZ NPC is public counterpart.
- **GG-ESIM Lot 4**: EUR 1-1.5M for urban development, circular waste, water/wastewater. 16 March 2026 concept note deadline. KIRAHub/SCIC Finnish consortium model.
- **DIF**: EUR 500k project preparation and structuring.

Cumulative subsidy pipeline value for Lanseria: EUR 2.5M+ across 8 applications.
