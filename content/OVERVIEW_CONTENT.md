## OVERVIEW: NWL

### Summary

New Water Lanseria (NWL) is the water infrastructure operating company within the Lanseria Smart City development. NWL **shall own and operate** a decentralised wastewater treatment plant using advanced Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor (MABR) technology supplied by OxyMem (a DuPont brand, Ireland) and integrated by Colubris Water Solutions (Netherlands).

### Investment Thesis

South Africa's development pipeline is blocked by the collapse of municipal bulk infrastructure. Legally, municipalities must provide water, sewer, and electricity for new developments (SPLUMA 2013), but are increasingly unable to do so — the 2023 Green Drop Watch Report flagged 334 plants for urgent regulatory intervention, with 39% in critical condition.

The City of Johannesburg, in correspondence dated 6 December 2016, confirmed that bulk infrastructure for Lanseria Extensions 35 and 36 may be provided by the developer at its own cost — implicitly acknowledging the municipality was not in a position to provide these services itself.

The GEPF-owned land within the Lanseria Smart City corridor has remained legally undevelopable due to the absence of compliant bulk sanitation. Without NWL, the land is legally frozen. With NWL, it becomes development-ready — enabling Crosspoint to start earthworks, conclude lease agreements, and trigger prepayments for bulk sanitation capacity. This "no services, no development" blockage is nationwide — NWL demonstrates a replicable private utility model.

### Assets


### Revenue Model

1. **Sewage treatment fees** — GreenField piped connections + BrownField honeysucker revenue sharing
2. **Water reuse sales** — TopCo piped reuse + construction water + agriculture overflow
3. **Bulk Services capacity payments** — GEPF + Social Housing prepayments for bulk sanitation capacity

## OVERVIEW: LanRED

### Summary

LanRED is the renewable energy operating company within the Lanseria Smart City development. LanRED shall own and operate distributed solar PV and battery storage installations across the Lanseria industrial estate and beyond, providing energy security and cost savings to commercial and industrial off-takers.

### Investment Thesis

LanRED addresses energy security in a country facing persistent load-shedding and grid instability. On-site solar generation with battery storage provides reliable, cost-effective power to Lanseria tenants while reducing carbon emissions. LanRED is **independently underwritten or has the provision of cross currency swap**.

### Greenfield

LanRED operates as a standalone energy utility serving the NWL water treatment facility and the broader Lanseria Smart City development. Revenue starts from commissioning (M18) with inter-company power supply to NWL, followed by PPA revenue from Smart City tenants and BESS arbitrage. An overdraft facility covers early-year shortfalls before full PPA revenues materialise.

### Brownfield+

LanRED operates with Day 1 PPA revenue from existing brownfield tenants immediate cash flow and power security. The existing tenant base provides a revenue floor while Smart City absorption ramps.

### Assets


### Revenue Model

Power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Lanseria tenants, grid savings contracts (on-site generation vs Eskom tariff), and wheeling arrangements for surplus power distribution. Revenue is underpinned by the significant tariff differential between solar levelised cost and escalating grid tariffs.

## OVERVIEW: Timberworx

### Summary

Timberworx is a **service company** within the Lanseria Smart City development. It shall operate a pre-fab manufacturing facility catering to a large pipeline of timber houses and buildings within the Smart City area, and the Centre of Excellence (CoE) which serves as a training and awareness centre for water and timber applications, demonstrating timber construction technologies.

### Investment Thesis

Timberworx addresses the housing and construction deficit in South Africa through industrialised timber construction. South Africa has a **3.7 million+ unit housing backlog**, growing at 178,000 units/year against delivery of just 25,000. The Centre of Excellence serves as the manufacturing pipeline — flat pack timber panels fabricated on-site, assembled by Greenblocks (EPC partner) at delivery locations. Revenue is purely service-based: fabrication fees per house, with no raw material cost (procured by EPC/JV). 

### Assets


### Revenue Model

1. **House/panel fabrication sales** — R100k/house service fee (5% p.a. escalation), permanent revenue stream. Timberworx is a service company: labour only, no raw material cost
2. **CoE rental & training income** — Lease income from CoE facility + training programme fees. Ceases at Year 4 when CoE is sold to LLC at 10% premium

## OVERVIEW: SCLCA Corporate

### Introduction

**Smart City Lanseria** is an orchestrator of demand across the Lanseria Smart City industrial estate, coordinating infrastructure value streams like **water management**, **energy security**, **pre-fab timber manufacturing**, waste management and sovereign cloud services. The development sits within an area of **50 MLD latent potential** for water demand. NWL is planning to cater to the first phase of Smart City Lanseria with a **2 MLD** sewage treatment and water-reuse plant. **SCLCA** is the financial holding company that manages the capital division for the operating companies (OpCos), borrowing at holding level and deploying intercompany loans to each subsidiary.

### Lanseria Smart City

**Lanseria Smart City** is a large-scale integrated urban development located adjacent to Lanseria International Airport in Gauteng, South Africa. The development is designed as a new-generation smart city encompassing residential, commercial, industrial, and catalytic infrastructure across the Lanseria extensions (Ext 35, 36, 37). The project is positioned within the Greater Lanseria Master Plan (GLMP) area, which has been designated by the Gauteng Provincial Government as a priority growth node. The development sits within an area of **50 MLD latent potential** for water demand — NWL's initial 2 MLD plant serves the first phase, with significant expansion headroom.

### DevCo

**Smart City Lanseria DevCo** is the master development company responsible for the overarching Lanseria Smart City development. DevCo coordinates land development, township establishment, and the roll-out of bulk and connector infrastructure across the Lanseria extensions. It is the entity through which the promoters exercises their development mandate. DevCo's role is upstream of the financing: it creates the demand environment (residential and commercial off-take) into which the catalytic infrastructure is deployed.

### SCLCA

**Catalytic Assets (SCLCA)** is the financial holding company and the direct borrower from Invest International Capital B.V. (IIC) and Creation Capital. SCLCA receives the senior debt facility and the mezzanine facility and deploys these as intercompany loans to its three operating subsidiaries: New Water Lanseria, LanRED, and Timberworx. SCLCA does not itself operate assets — it is a pure financial intermediary whose balance sheet consists of intercompany loan receivables, subsidiary equity holdings, bank accounts, and the FEC funded by Creation Capital. SCLCA is the entity whose entire balance sheet is pledged to IIC as Layer 1 security.

### InfraCo

**Smart City Lanseria InfraCo** is the infrastructure company responsible for the design, construction, and commissioning of bulk services infrastructure that supports the broader Lanseria Smart City development. InfraCo handles the civil works, bulk water supply, sewerage trunk mains, and road infrastructure that connect the catalytic assets (water plant, CoE, solar) to the municipal grid and to the development parcels. InfraCo is the counterpart that ensures the catalytic assets can physically serve the growing development.

### LLC

**Lanseria LLC** (the land and legal compliance entity) manages the land holdings, servitudes, and regulatory compliance for the Lanseria extensions. This includes the land on which the catalytic assets sit (funded separately via equity, excluded from the debt financing), the environmental authorisations (EA from Gauteng Province, Sept 2022), the township establishment processes, and the SG diagrams for Ext 35, 36, and 37. The land value is excluded from the SCLCA debt structure.
