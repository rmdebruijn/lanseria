## Deal Structure — Greenfield + Brownfield

### Greenfield (EUR 3M budget, on consortium-owned land)

Allocated in order of priority:

| Priority | Asset | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Rooftop solar — Water Plant & CoE | Rooftop solar for NWL water treatment plant and Timberworx Centre of Excellence |
| 2 | BESS — Water Plant & CoE | Battery energy storage as Eskom hedge for water plant and CoE |
| 3 | Substation investment | Eskom substation — details pending Eskom response |
| 4 | Large-scale BESS | Standalone battery storage for grid arbitrage and demand management |
| 5 | On-ground solar | Ground-mount solar on available consortium land |

**Key constraints:**
- Zero EPC risk / headaches — turnkey delivery by EPC contractor
- Simple execution — no construction management by promoters
- BESS-heavy preference for Eskom hedge value

### Brownfield (EUR 10M+)

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Asset type | Running solar / BESS assets |
| PPA | Long-term PPA in place (preference) |
| Surplus | Surplus generation to wheel to Lanseria or utilise via upcoming energy exchange |
| Acquisition model | Portfolio acquisition of operational assets with proven cash flows |
| Scale | EUR 10M or more, over and above greenfield allocation |

**Note:** Cala to provide further detail on exchange mechanism and wheeling options.
