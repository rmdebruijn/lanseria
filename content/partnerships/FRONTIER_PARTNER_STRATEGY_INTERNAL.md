# Frontier Funding Partner Strategy

## Internal Goal-Setting Document
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Audience:** NexusNovus leadership and execution team  
**Purpose:** Define how Frontier Funding is carried by partner capacity, allocate specific roles, and set measurable internal goals.

---

## 1. Strategic Intent
Frontier Funding (FF) is our operating model for **risk arbitrage in infrastructure delivery**.

FF is not generic fundraising. FF is the disciplined conversion of development uncertainty into financeable structure by sequencing parties that each carry the risk they are best positioned to hold.

FF is also our PRI model: **Principal Risk Intermediation**.

- We intermediate risk, not only money.
- We allocate risk to the right institutional balance sheet at the right time.
- We recycle first-loss capacity after risk decay and underwriting conversion.

### FF Definition (Repeatable Internal Version)
Frontier Funding is a structured financing model that:
1. Starts with technology and exporter reality, not abstract capital assumptions.
2. Uses first-loss and guarantee architecture to make projects lendable earlier.
3. Converts structure into ECA-compatible credit pathways.
4. Pulls DFI/bank liquidity once the risk profile is institution-ready.

### Vendor-First Doctrine
We are vendor-first because vendors unlock the two engines that make FF work:
- **ECA access** (export-credit eligibility and exporter-of-record mechanics)
- **Subsidy access** (exporter-linked subsidy pathways for incubation replenishment)

Without vendor structuring early, FF cannot scale.

### Strategic Bottlenecks We Must Solve
1. No centralized captive first-loss platform yet (must be built and governed).
2. No centralized captive integrator-wrapper capability for repeatable ECA packaging.
3. Role boundaries historically blurred across sourcing, risk structuring, and ECA execution.
4. Inconsistent mandate language creates fee conflict and slows execution.

---

## 2. Operating Principle
We run a controlled **hub-and-spoke system**.

- **Hub (NexusNovus):** PMO, IC, dashboard governance, standards, role assignment, approval gates.
- **Spokes (partners):** domain execution in clearly bounded layers.

## 4. Cross-Role Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. Origination can enter through any partner; ownership does not imply full-stack control.
2. Program orchestration stays centralized in NexusNovus dashboard governance.
3. Integrators can advise ECA; they do not own ECA execution authority.
4. No group-wide exclusivity. Allocation is project-specific and written.
5. Every external commitment must map to a designated mandate object.

### ASCII Flow: Frontier Funding Chain

## 5. Governance and Partner Rights

## 5.1 NexusNovus Central Rights
- Assign and revoke role ownership by project.
- Approve integrator shortlist and exporter concentration strategy.
- Approve first-loss architecture and ECA go/no-go.
- Control document standards, data schema, and reporting cadence.
- Enforce conflict resolution and mandate hygiene.

## 5.2 Partner Rights
- Propose opportunities, structures, and counterparties within domain.
- Recommend sub-partners/sub-agents.
- Execute only within approved mandate scope.

## 5.3 Sub-Partner Rule
Partners may appoint sub-partners/sub-agents only when:
1. Role fit is documented.
2. Commercial terms are disclosed.
3. NexusNovus approves in writing.
4. Performance and reporting obligations are attached to the mandate.

---

## 6. Contract Architecture (One Body, Multiple Annexes)
We operate one standard contract body across all three partners, with role-specific annexes.

## 6.1 Core Body (Same for All)
- Definitions and scope discipline
- Designated transaction allocation
- Non-exclusive framework with project-specific allocation
- Trigger logic for compensation
- Governance, auditability, and reporting duties
- Termination and tail conditions

## 6.2 Annex Stack
- **Annex A:** Role matrix (primary/secondary boundaries) and fee schedule
- **Annex B:** Project mandate schedule (designated transactions)
- **Annex C:** Sub-agent schedule and pass-through economics



- **Annex E**: Equity Conversion Right
- **Annex R:** Retainer schedule and offset mechanism
- **Annex S:** Special structures (JV, captive cell, bespoke instruments)

---

## 7. Fee Architecture and Stacking Logic
Fee logic must reflect where value and risk are actually carried.

## 7.1 Stackable Fee Components
- Origination component (only if materially attributable and documented)
- Structure component (first-loss/equity-mezz/guarantee design)
- Conversion component (ECA packaging and institutional conversion)
- Execution component (milestone-linked delivery)

## 7.2 Anti-Double-Count Rules
- No fee on the same value event under two labels.
- No success fee before valid trigger event.
- No open-ended group-wide capture through vague language.

## 7.3 Trigger Discipline
- “Term sheet seen” is not a success event by itself.
- Success is tied to defined contractual milestones (close, drawdown, verified commitment, or approved equivalent trigger per annex).

## 7.4 Calculation Method (Internal)
For each designated transaction:
- Fee Base = approved value base in Annex C
- Component Rate = role-specific rate in Annex C
- Payable = Fee Base x Component Rate x Trigger Achievement Factor

All exceptions must be pre-approved and logged.

---

## 8. Retainer Model (How It Works)
Retainers are operating-capacity prepayments, not unconditional entitlement.

## 8.1 Principles
- Retainer applies only where active in Annex E.
- Retainer accrues against delivery obligations.
- Retainer offsets against future success fees where defined.

## 8.2 Stop/Adjust Rules
- If mandate stops, retainer treatment follows pro-rata and offset rules.
- If performance milestones are missed, retainer continuation can be paused.
- Retainer does not waive trigger requirements for success fees.

---

## 9. KPI Framework for Internal Goal Setting

## 9.1 Portfolio KPIs
- Origination-to-structure cycle time
- % projects with complete mandate + annex pack
- % projects with approved integrator/exporter concentration plan
- ECA conversion funnel (qualified -> submitted -> approved)
- First-loss capacity utilization and recycle velocity

## 9.2 Partner KPIs
### Philip
- Qualified opportunities per month
- Conversion to mandate-ready intake (%)
- Integrator bench coverage score (region x sector)

### Carl
- First-loss memo timeliness (%)
- Counterparty conversion rate (guarantor/underwriter/sponsor)
- Internal structure approval rate at IC

### Robbert
- % projects with ECA path before engineering lock
- First-pass submission quality rate
- Country specialist effectiveness (cycle-time + quality)

---

## 10. 90-Day Plan

## Day 0-30
- Freeze role matrix and annex taxonomy.
- Stand up mandate object in dashboard.
- Publish integrator bench criteria and shortlist v1.

## Day 31-60

- Activate country specialist roster with assignment rules.

## Day 61-90
