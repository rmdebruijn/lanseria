# Inter-Company Entity Structure

**Document Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Working draft — ownership percentages to be confirmed in shareholders agreements

---

## 1. Three Views of the Structure

This document describes the corporate structure across three lenses:

1. **IIC / ECA View** — what lenders and export credit agencies see (simplest possible)
2. **Transition Roadmap** — sequenced steps from current state to final state
3. **Final Target Structure** — end-state after all restructuring completes

---

## 2. IIC / ECA Submission View

Presented to Invest International, Atradius, and other institutional parties. Two UBOs, minimal entities.

```
UBOs:
  Sizakele Mabuza-Kekana (Promoter)
  Mark van Houten (Co-Investor)

Sizakele → Andzafusion Water (Pty) Ltd ─┐
                                         ├─► Smart City Lanseria DevCo (Pty) Ltd
Mark → VH Investments Trust (VHIT) ─────┘

DevCo
└── 100% ──► Catalytic Assets (Pty) Ltd ("CA" / SCLCA)
              ├── 93%   New Water Lanseria (Pty) Ltd
              ├── 100%  LanRED (Pty) Ltd
              └── 5%    Timberworx (Pty) Ltd

Other shareholders visible to IIC:
  Crosspoint          →  7% NWL
  VanSquared          → 95% TWX (owned by VHIT)

Not shown at IIC stage: Cradle Cloud, IWSA, Jan, Nordic partners, Crosspoint 2
```

**Design principle:** Fewest entities, cleanest lines. NexusNovus is deliberately absent (Atradius reputational risk from Indian entity name association). Can be introduced post-close via contractual substitution.

## 3. Transition Roadmap

Sequenced steps from current state to final structure. Steps T-1 through T-5 affect the IIC submission. Steps T-6 onward are post-close.

### Pre-Close (affects IIC view)

| Step | Action | Parties | Dependency | Status |
|------|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| T-1 | DevCo SHA — agree Andzafusion / VHIT split | Siza, Mark | DTIC requirement on Siza's initial holding determines split | Not drafted |
| T-2 | NWL share sale — Crosspoint 2 buys 7% from Andzafusion | Andzafusion (seller), Crosspoint 2 (buyer) | Siza currently holds 100% of NWL. **Note:** Crosspoint may be acceptable to NOT take NWL shares, provided they are adequately compensated for the property option they brought to the table. | Not drafted |
| T-3 | Crosspoint land option — 25% GEPF land bank option sold to LLC | Crosspoint, LLC | Crosspoint renames parcel option to [new name]; Crosspoint 2 takes shares in [new name] | Open |
| T-4 | NWL JV cross-equity swap — haulage partners get max 5% NWL at VALUE | NWL, JV haulage partners | CP item — SHA, governance, conflict protocol must be agreed | CP listed |
| T-5 | IWSA formation — CA takes 95%, Nordic partners 5% | CA, Nordic partners | IWSA SPV formation | Not started |

### Post-Close (secured via option agreements at close)

| Step | Action | Parties | Dependency | Status |
|------|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| T-6 | VanSquared TWX split — 50/50 Mark / Eckhardt | Mark, Eckhardt | Immediately post-close | Not drafted |
| T-7 | Werner + Rutger introduced to TWX | Werner, Rutger, Mark, Eckhardt | T-6 | Not started |
| T-8 | CoE asset sold from TWX to LLC company | TWX, LLC entity | T-6, valuation TBD | Not started |
| T-9 | Mark + Rutger establish Mauritius trusts → NexusNovus Holdings | Mark, Rutger | Post-close, Atradius risk cleared | Deferred |
| T-10 | NexusNovus replaces VHIT as DevCo shareholder | NexusNovus Holdings, VHIT | T-9, contractual substitution | Deferred |
| T-11 | Mark + Rutger roll TWX shares into NexusNovus | NexusNovus, VanSquared successors | T-7, T-9 | Deferred |
| T-12 | VanSquared LLC split — 50% split into M 25% + E 25% | Mark, Eckhardt | VanSquared currently holds 50% LLC | Not drafted |
| T-13 | R+M+S collapse LLC shares into DevCo — E stays direct | Rutger, Mark, Siza, DevCo; Eckhardt retains 25% direct | T-10, T-12 | Option |

## 4. Final Target Structure

End-state after all transitions complete:

```
UBOs:

  Mark van Houten (Co-Investor)
  Rutger [surname] (Co-Investor)

Sizakele → Andzafusion Water (Pty) Ltd ──┐
                                         ├─► Smart City Lanseria DevCo
Mark → Mark's Trust (Mauritius) ──┐      │
                                   ├─► NexusNovus Holdings ──┘
Rutger → Rutger's Trust (Mauritius)┘

LLC (Lanseria Landowners Consortium):
  Andzafusion (Siza)    → 25%  (via DevCo)
  NexusNovus (Mark)     → 25%  (via DevCo)
  NexusNovus (Rutger)   → 25%  (via DevCo)
  Eckhardt              → 25%  (direct — split from VanSquared)

  VanSquared currently holds 50% (M+E) — must be split into 25% M + 25% E
  R+M+S shares collapse into DevCo; E stays direct at 25%
  Eckhardt moving into DevCo is not currently contemplated
  Post-collapse: LLC held 75% DevCo + 25% Eckhardt direct

DevCo

```

## 5. NWL Cross-Equity Swap Detail

NWL may be required to do a cross-equity swap with JV haulage partners:
- NWL gives up to **5% equity** to haulage JV partners
- This is at **value** — 5% of NWL at project valuation could represent 50% in the haulage company given the value differential
- Already considered as CP item (before close):
  - Cross-equity structure must be agreed in both SHAs
  - Truck investment mechanism and per-truck equity uplift formula documented
  - Information rights and governance provisions agreed
  - Equity–haulage separation confirmed — conflict of interest protocol, recusal obligations, investor veto on haulage terms

## 6. Key Principles

1. **IIC sees the simplest possible structure** — 2 UBOs, no NexusNovus, no staged transitions
2. **Everything post-close is secured via option agreements** signed at close — easy to execute later
3. **NexusNovus introduction is deferred** until Atradius risk is cleared — contractual substitution mechanism in DevCo SHA
4. **DTIC conditions** may require Andzafusion to hold a specific initial % in DevCo — this drives the x%/y% split
5. **Crosspoint 2 is a separate entity** from original Crosspoint — buys NWL shares from Siza's company
6. **Nordic partners only participate in IWSA** — not in CA/top structure

## 7. Open Consensus Items

These require agreement among principals before structures can be finalised:

| # | Question | Decides |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Andzafusion % in DevCo (DTIC requirement)? | UBO diagram x%/y% pills |
| 2 | Crosspoint 2 NWL: confirmed at 7%, or compensated via property option value instead? | Financial model + security package |
| 3 | JV haulage cross-equity: which companies, what %? | NWL SHA, dilution modeling |
| 4 | VanSquared TWX split — Mark/Eckhardt/Werner/Rutger final %s? | TWX SHA |
| 5 | CoE asset sale to LLC: at what valuation? | TWX balance sheet |
| 6 | IWSA: which Nordic partners? Formation timeline? | CA portfolio |
| 7 | Crosspoint land option: new name for parcel? | LLC structure |
| 8 | Jan's 20% Cradle Cloud: entity vehicle? | Cradle Cloud SHA |
