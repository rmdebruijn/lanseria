# MASTER PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (DRAFT)

**This Master Partnership Agreement** (the "Agreement") is made and entered into on **[Effective Date]**

between:

**NexusNovus Capital B.V.**, a private company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its registered office at **[Address]**, registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number **[KvK Number]** ("NexusNovus");

and

**[Partner Legal Name]**, a **[legal form]** incorporated under the laws of **[jurisdiction]**, having its registered office at **[Address]**, registered under number **[registration number]** ("Partner").

NexusNovus and Partner are hereinafter each a "Party" and together the "Parties".

---

## RECITALS (WHEREAS)

A. NexusNovus develops and finances critical infrastructure and utility platforms in frontier and emerging markets through a structured model known as Frontier Funding.

B. Traditional project-finance structures assume bankability at entry and therefore do not fit frontier projects. The Incubation Phase transforms raw projects into Frontier Funding-eligible form. Frontier Funding then finances those eligible projects through the Credit Stack. Incubation and Frontier Funding are sequential and distinct: incubation crafts eligibility; Frontier Funding executes the financing.

C. The core engine of Frontier Funding is first-loss architecture: by absorbing primary risk through guarantees, cash-backed instruments, and captive insurance structures, the Credit Stack enables export-credit cover (or alternative credit-conversion routes), which in turn enables institutional debt. The greater the first-loss absorption, the thinner the credit-conversion requirement.

D. NexusNovus has raised and manages a Development Fund used to fund the Incubation Phase toward Frontier Funding eligibility. The Development Fund operates as a revolving mechanism replenished through success fees at financial close and subsidy inflows.

E. The Vendor-First Principle is essential: technology and exporter structuring must precede capital structuring because export-credit and subsidy channels depend on exporter-of-record positioning. The Parties acknowledge that hand-selected exporters of record are required for both subsidy applications and Frontier Funding execution.

F. This Agreement governs framework cooperation and Designated Transaction mandates, while keeping project-level assignment, economics, and performance auditable and enforceable.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows.

## 1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

1.1 In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise:

- "Affiliate" means any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a Party.
- "Annex" means an annex attached to this Agreement and incorporated by reference.
- "Business Day" means a day (other than Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday) on which banks are open in Amsterdam.
- "Covered Amount" means the notional risk coverage of a specific Layer instrument within a Credit Stack, not the full project size.
- "Credit Stack" means the layered capital structure assembled for a Designated Transaction, comprising Layers A through D as described in Clause 6.
- "Designated Transaction" means a project or mandate expressly allocated in writing under Annex B.
- "Development Fund" means the revolving internal project-development fund described in Clause 3, used to incubate projects toward Frontier Funding eligibility.
- "Fee Item" means a variable-based fee line defined in Annex A.
- "Fee Trigger" means a contractual event that gives rise to a payment factor for a Fee Item.
- "Follow-On Liquidity" means debt or DFI facilities arising as a consequence of Layer B credit conversion being in place, whether through ECA, underwriting, swap, or a combination thereof.
- "Frontier Funding" means the structured financing of projects that have achieved Frontier Funding eligibility, using the Credit Stack described in Clause 6 to move eligible projects through financial close via sequenced capital deployment across first-loss, credit conversion, and institutional liquidity.
- "Incubation Phase" means the internal NexusNovus project development phase funded through the Development Fund, in which a raw project is structured and transformed into a Frontier Funding-eligible project within required quality and timing thresholds. Incubation precedes Frontier Funding; the two are sequential and distinct.
- "Integrator" means a company-captive or company-controlled entity handling ECA applications on behalf of project vehicles across multiple Designated Transactions.
- "Layer" means one of four tiers in the Credit Stack: Layer A (first-loss / risk absorption), Layer B (credit conversion — ECA, underwriting, or swap routes), Layer C (debt / DFI / Follow-On Liquidity), Layer D (supplier credit / exporter cash-flow bridge).
- "Primary Work Scope" and "Secondary Work Scope" are operational focus classifications only and do not by themselves create payment entitlement.
- "Repeat-Decay Function" means the fee-decay formula defined in Clause 7.4 and Annex A, reducing fees on repeat instances of origination or technology work from the same source.
- "Slab" means a fixed incremental fee percentage applied per additional Credit Stack layer, calculated on that layer's Covered Amount as set out in Clause 7.5.
- "Sub-Agent" means a person or entity engaged by a Party to support services under a Designated Transaction.
- "Vendor-First Principle" means the operating doctrine requiring technology and exporter structuring to precede capital structuring in order to unlock export-credit and subsidy channels.

1.2 Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.

1.3 In case of conflict, precedence applies in this order: Agreement body, Annex B, Annex A, Annex R, Annex E, Annex C, Annex S, then other schedules.

## 2. FRONTIER FUNDING PRINCIPLES

2.1 **Credit Construction Philosophy.** Frontier Funding finances projects that have been made eligible through Incubation. Once eligible, the financing operates on the principle that risk must be absorbed before it can be converted and converted before it can attract liquidity. The sequence is: risk absorption, then credit conversion, then liquidity deployment — not the reverse.

2.2 **Layered Capital Structure.** Each Designated Transaction is structured through a Credit Stack of up to four Layers:

- **Layer A** — First-loss / risk absorption (guarantees, cash-backed instruments, captive insurance)
- **Layer B** — Credit conversion (ECA cover, underwriting/insurance wrap, currency swap as credit instrument)
- **Layer C** — Debt / DFI / bank liquidity (Follow-On Liquidity)
- **Layer D** — Supplier credit (Bills of Exchange discounting to bridge exporter cash flow)

2.3 **Vendor-First Principle.** Technology and exporter structuring must be completed before capital structuring begins. Exporter-of-record positioning unlocks both ECA access and subsidy pathways. Without vendor structuring, Frontier Funding cannot execute.

2.4 **Dependency Chain.** Each Layer depends on the Layer beneath it:

- Layer A enables Layer B: first-loss absorption makes credit conversion (ECA or alternatives) possible.
- Layer B enables Layer C: credit conversion (whichever route) makes institutional debt and DFI liquidity possible.
- Layer C enables Layer D: confirmed debt facilities enable supplier-credit discounting (Bills of Exchange bridge for exporter cash flow).

Within Layer A, each instrument (corporate guarantee, PE cash-backed guarantee, captive cell insurance) reduces the size and cost of Layer B. A sufficiently large Layer A may render Layer B unnecessary or reduce it to a narrow residual.

---

## 3. DEVELOPMENT FUND

3.1 **Purpose.** NexusNovus maintains a Development Fund for the Incubation Phase. The Development Fund finances project preparation toward Frontier Funding eligibility within required quality and timing thresholds.

3.2 **Allocation.** The Development Fund is sized at EUR 3,500,000 on a revolving basis. Allocations to specific Designated Transactions are at NexusNovus sole discretion.

3.3 **Replenishment.** The Development Fund is replenished from two sources:

- success fees received at financial close of Designated Transactions; and
- subsidy inflows from vendor-linked pathways as described in Clause 8.

3.4 **Strategic Role.** The Development Fund drives pipeline speed and quality. All partners benefit from the fund's capacity to incubate projects, and the fund must flow back through successful execution. The Parties acknowledge that the revolving nature of the Development Fund is essential to sustained Frontier Funding activity.

---

## 4. APPOINTMENT, CONTRACT NATURE, AND MASTER SCOPE

4.1 NexusNovus appoints Partner on a framework basis to provide services under this Agreement, subject to written allocation of each Designated Transaction under a numbered Schedule B-n within Annex B (where n is the transaction index; each project receives its own schedule).

4.2 No general or implied mandate exists outside Annex B allocations.

4.3 This Agreement is non-exclusive at framework level, except where expressly stated for a specific Designated Transaction in Annex B.

4.4 Services may include, as allocated per Designated Transaction:

- (a) Project origination;
- (b) Technology and Exporter Pre-Selection;
- (c) First-loss / guarantee architecture;
- (d) Equity / mezzanine structuring;
- (e) ECA packaging and credit conversion;
- (f) Non-recourse debt structuring;
- (g) Credit-enhanced development debt (DFI);
- (h) Underwriting / swap pathway support;
- (i) Subsidy access (vendor-linked);
- (j) Supplier credit related supplier working capital (Layer D).

Note: first-loss (Layer A) enables ECA and alternative credit conversion (Layer B) by absorbing primary project risk such that credit agencies and institutional underwriters can cover the residual. An ECA or equivalent credit-conversion instrument makes DFI and bank liquidity (Layer C) possible. This causal chain is fundamental to Frontier Funding.

4.5 Partner shall not perform services outside approved scope without prior written approval from NexusNovus in accordance with Clause 20.

---

## 5. DEAL ORIGINATION, TECHNOLOGY SOURCING, AND SOURCE TRACKING

**Origination Pipeline**

5.1 **Origination Introduction Rights.** Any Partner may introduce project opportunities. Introduction does not imply full-stack control over the resulting Designated Transaction; role allocation follows NexusNovus governance per Clause 12.

5.2 **Repeat-Origination Reduction.** Where a Partner repeatedly originates deals from the same source (promoter or developer), fees on subsequent instances from that source decay per the Repeat-Decay Function in Annex A. The decay reflects diminishing marginal contribution per repeat introduction.

5.3 **Origination Source Tracking.** Partner shall maintain attribution records per originator and promoter, and make these available to NexusNovus on request.

**Technology Pipeline**

5.4 **Technology Introduction Rights.** Any Partner may introduce technology providers and exporters. Introduction of a technology provider does not imply control over its deployment across Designated Transactions.

5.5 **Repeat-Technology Reduction.** Where a Partner repeatedly deploys the same technology provider or exporter across Designated Transactions, fees on subsequent instances from that provider decay per the Repeat-Decay Function in Annex A. Technology decay is tracked per provider, independently of origination decay.

5.6 **Technology Source Tracking.** Partner shall maintain attribution records per technology provider and exporter, and make these available to NexusNovus on request.

Attribution records under 5.3 and 5.6 form part of Fee Trigger verification under Clause 7.



---

## 6. CREDIT STACK STRUCTURE

6.1 **Layer A — First-Loss / Primary Risk Absorption.**

Layer A instruments absorb primary project risk so that subsequent Layers can operate on a reduced risk basis. Layer A instruments include:

- **Corporate guarantee** — balance-sheet-backed, strategic in nature; the guarantor bears full exposure.
- **PE cash-backed guarantee** — cash collateral or SBLC-equivalent; direct cash commitment.
- **Captive cell insurance** — first-loss insurance structure (Annex S where applicable) absorbing defined risk tranches.

The greater the Layer A absorption, the thinner the Layer B requirement. Each Layer A instrument individually reduces Layer B: a large corporate guarantee, a PE cash-backed guarantee, or a captive cell insurance placement each narrows the residual that Layer B must cover. A sufficiently large Layer A (from one instrument or a combination) may render Layer B unnecessary or reduce it to a narrow residual.

6.2 **Layer B — Credit Conversion.**

Layer B converts remaining project risk into institutionally acceptable credit exposure. Three routes exist, which may be alternative or complementary per Designated Transaction:

- **Route 1: ECA cover** — converts remaining risk to sovereign/agency-backed insured exposure. The traditional Frontier Funding pathway.
- **Route 2: Underwriting / insurance wrap** — places exposure on institutional balance sheets (banks, insurers). May replace ECA entirely or reduce ECA to a thinner residual.
- **Route 3: Currency swap as credit instrument** — places FX and credit exposure on institutional counterparties. May similarly replace or thin ECA requirements.

Both Layer A (from below) and Layer B alternatives (from within) can reduce or eliminate ECA requirements. Multiple Layer B instruments may co-exist within one Designated Transaction; the relevant Schedule B-n specifies which routes apply.

6.3 **Layer C — Credit-Enhanced Development Debt / DFI / Bank Liquidity (Follow-On Liquidity).**

Layer C comprises institutional debt facilities enabled by Layer B credit conversion. This includes ECA-backed loans, DFI facilities, EU commercial bank debt, and local bank facilities. Layer C is Follow-On Liquidity: it arises as a consequence of credit conversion, not as a primary deliverable.

6.4 **Layer D — Supplier Credit / Exporter Cash-Flow Bridge.**

Layer D applies specifically in supplier-credit structures: Bills of Exchange issued under the supply contract are discounted (typically at month 18) to bridge the exporter's cash flow until project proceeds materialise. Layer D is enabled by confirmed Layer C debt commitments.

6.5 **Dependency Chain.** Layer A enables Layer B; Layer B (whichever route or combination) enables Layer C; Layer C enables Layer D. This chain governs sequencing, fee triggers, and priority in the Credit Stack.

## 7. FEES, FORMULAE, AND STACKING

7.1 Fee Items, variable values, and trigger mappings are set in Annex A.

7.2 Classification as Primary Work Scope or Secondary Work Scope is operational only and does not by itself entitle payment.

7.3 A Fee Item is payable only when all of the following apply:

- the Designated Transaction is validly allocated in Annex B;
- the Fee Item is active in Annex A;
- the applicable Fee Trigger factor is greater than zero;
- required evidence is accepted by NexusNovus.

7.4 **Fee Method Families.**

Each Fee Item must be assigned one method family in Annex A:

- **Fixed-Rate:** `Fee = R_i% x Base_i` — used for instruments where complexity scales with size (equity, mezzanine, non-recourse debt). The percentage is applied to the raised/closed amount.

- **Root-Curve:** `Fee_i = A x sqrt(B_i)` — used for instruments where complexity scales sub-linearly with size (first-loss, ECA, underwriting, swap structures). A is a fixed constant set in Annex A; B_i is the Covered Amount per Designated Transaction.

- **Repeat-Decay:** `Fee_i_j = B_i x (A / sqrt(j))` — used for repeat origination and technology pre-selection instances, where compensation declines per instance. A is a fixed starting percentage set in Annex A; B_i is the project value per Designated Transaction; j is the instance number from the same source.

7.5 **Slab Waterfall for Frontier Funding Layers (Root-Curve Items Only).**

Where a Designated Transaction involves multiple Credit Stack Layers with Root-Curve Fee Items, fees accrue as follows:

- **Layer A:** full fee per Root-Curve formula on Layer A Covered Amount.
- **Layer B:** additional +0.75% on Layer B Covered Amount.
- **Layer C:** additional +0.50% on Layer C Covered Amount.
- **Layer D:** additional +0.25% on Layer D Covered Amount.

Each Slab is applied to its own layer's Covered Amount, not the full project size. Fixed-Rate items (equity, mezzanine, non-recourse debt, subsidy) and Repeat-Decay items (origination, technology) are independent of the Slab waterfall and stack freely alongside it.

7.6 **Renewal-Decay and Increases (Root-Curve Items).**

Where a Root-Curve instrument is renewed or extended on the same Designated Transaction, the j-th renewal instance attracts a decayed fee: `Fee_i_j = A x sqrt(B_i) / sqrt(j)`, where j counts from 1 (initial) onward.

Where a Root-Curve instrument is increased (Covered Amount grows), the fee on the increase is calculated on the delta only: `Fee_delta = A x sqrt(delta_B_i)`, treated as a fresh calculation at j = 1 for the incremental amount.

7.7 **Anti-Double-Count Rule.** The same value event may not be paid more than once across Fee Items unless Annex B explicitly allows distinct, non-overlapping bases for each payment.

7.8 **Attribution Rule.** If multiple contributors claim the same trigger or value event, payment for the disputed share is withheld until NexusNovus resolves attribution.

7.9 **Total Amount Due.**

`Net Due = Gross - Offset_R - Offset_Other`

Where:

- `Gross` = sum of all approved Fee Items for the Designated Transaction;
- `Offset_R` = retainer offsets per Annex R;
- `Offset_Other` = other agreed credits or offsets.

---

## 8. SUBSIDY STRATEGY AND INCENTIVES

8.1 **Vendor-Linked Subsidy Pathways.** Partner shall support subsidy applications through exporter-of-record positioning as part of the Vendor-First Principle. Subsidy access depends on correct vendor structuring and is therefore inseparable from technology and exporter pre-selection activities under Clause 4.4(b).

8.2 **Development Fund Replenishment.** Subsidy inflows contribute to Development Fund replenishment per Clause 3.3.

8.3 **Retainer Linkage.** Where Annex R activates a retainer for a Partner, the retainer may be conditional on subsidy application initiation as specified in Annex R.

8.4 **Subsidy Success Fee.** A Partner who secures a subsidy for a Designated Transaction is entitled to a success fee on the subsidy amount secured, per Fee Item F-06 in Annex A. The subsidy success fee is a Fixed-Rate item and stacks independently of the Credit Stack Slab waterfall.

---

## 9. DESIGNATED TRANSACTIONS AND ALLOCATION
