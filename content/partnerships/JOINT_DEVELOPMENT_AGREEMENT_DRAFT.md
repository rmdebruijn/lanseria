# Joint Development Agreement

Joint Development Agreement
## Clause 1 — Purpose and Background
1.1 The Parties acknowledge that the Smart City development framework requires the identification, origination, and delivery of essential infrastructure platforms necessary for the proper functioning, resilience, and long-term sustainability of the Smart City ecosystem.
1.2 The Smart City, acting in its capacity as demand orchestrator, has identified the strategic need for a dedicated digital infrastructure and cloud platform (the Project) to support smart city operations, utility coordination, data sovereignty, and future regional scalability.
1.3 The Parties further acknowledge that the Project is at an early origination stage and requires structured development, consortium formation, technical definition, and financing preparation prior to implementation or operational deployment.
1.4 The purpose of this Joint Development Agreement (the Agreement) is to appoint the Development Promoter for the Project, to define the scope of its development mandate, and to set out the economic principles governing such role during the development phase only.
1.5 This Agreement is expressly limited to the development, structuring, and financing preparation of the Project and does not govern long-term operations, management, or ownership arrangements beyond the achievement of Financial Close, which shall be addressed under separate agreements, if applicable.

  (b) The Development Promoter, being the entity identified in Annexure A (Development Promoter Name) and duly incorporated under the laws of the jurisdiction specified in Annexure A (Governing Law).

2.2 The Parties acknowledge that:
  (a) the Lanseria Landowners Consortium (LLC) is the landholding entity only and is not a party to this Agreement; and
  (b) NexusNovus acts as an independent structuring and de-risking platform and may be engaged in connection with the Project, but is not a contracting party to this Agreement unless expressly agreed in writing.
